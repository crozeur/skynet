  "content": "<h2 id=\"intro\">Intro</h2>\r\nSecurity audits don’t have to be painful, expensive, or reserved for large enterprises. For SMEs, the goal is simple: quickly verify that the security basics are actually working, and that the riskiest gaps are visible and owned. This post gives you a lightweight approach you can run quarterly (and before major changes) without claiming “compliance.” Use it to gather evidence, spot high-impact fixes, and create a short, trackable action plan.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"quick-take\">Quick take</h2>\r\n<ul><li>Define scope and “crown jewels” first, or you’ll audit everything and learn nothing.</li><li>Ask for evidence (screenshots, logs, configs, tickets), not promises.</li><li>Prioritize identity, patching, backups, and monitoring—most SME incidents start there.</li><li>Turn findings into owners, due dates, and verification steps.</li><li>Repeat on a cadence (quarterly) and after major changes (new SaaS, M&A, new firewall).</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"1-set-the-audit-scope-systems-data-and-acceptable-risk\">1) Set the audit scope: systems, data, and acceptable risk</h2>\r\nA good SME audit starts with boundaries. If you don’t define what matters most, your checklist becomes a long list of “nice-to-haves” and your team loses momentum.\r\n\r\nPractical steps:\r\n1. List your critical business services (e.g., email, file storage, ERP/finance, customer database, e-commerce, remote access). These are your primary audit targets.\r\n2. Identify your “crown jewel” data types: customer PII, payment data, credentials/secrets, intellectual property, financial records.\r\n3. Map where that data lives: endpoints, servers, SaaS apps, cloud storage, on-prem shares.\r\n4. Define risk tolerance in plain language. Example: “We accept brief outages for internal tools, but not for billing; we can tolerate low-risk data exposure, but not customer PII.”\r\n\r\nExample: If your customer database is in a SaaS CRM and your staff authenticate via a single identity provider, your audit should spend more time on identity controls (MFA, conditional access, logging) than on local server hardening.\r\n\r\nDeliverable to produce:\r\n<ul><li>A one-page scope document: in-scope apps, networks, user groups, and a short “out of scope” list.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"2-collect-evidence-efficiently-and-avoid-checkbox-theater\">2) Collect evidence efficiently (and avoid checkbox theater)</h2>\r\nAudits fail when they rely on verbal assurances: “Yes, we do backups.” Your goal is to collect lightweight evidence that a control exists and is effective.\r\n\r\nEvidence types that work well for SMEs:\r\n<ul><li>Screenshots of key settings (MFA enforced, password policy, device encryption).</li><li>Exported lists (admin accounts, MFA enrollment report, list of SaaS integrations).</li><li>Sample logs (sign-in logs, endpoint alerts, firewall denies) covering the last 7–30 days.</li><li>Tickets or change records showing patching, access approvals, and incidents.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nHow to sample without boiling the ocean:\r\n<ul><li>Pick a representative sample: 10–20 endpoints, 3–5 critical servers, 5–10 key SaaS apps.</li><li>Sample by risk: executives, finance, IT admins, and remote users first.</li><li>Validate “control works” by testing. Example: attempt to log in to a test account without MFA; confirm it is blocked.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nExample “evidence request” you can send internally:\r\n<ul><li>“Provide the list of accounts with global admin privileges and proof of MFA enforcement.”</li><li>“Provide the last successful restore test record (date, system, result).”</li><li>“Provide the patch report showing OS and browser patch status for all managed endpoints.”</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"3-audit-the-controls-that-stop-real-world-sme-incidents\">3) Audit the controls that stop real-world SME incidents</h2>\r\nMost SME compromises trace back to a small set of control failures: weak identity hygiene, exposed remote access, unpatched systems, poor backups, and limited detection.\r\n\r\nBelow are practical audit themes and what “good” looks like—without overcomplicating it.\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"identity-and-access-especially-admins\">Identity and access (especially admins)</h3>\r\n<ul><li>Ensure MFA is required for all users, and stronger requirements exist for admins.</li><li>Reduce the number of admin accounts; use separate admin identities for privileged work.</li><li>Review third-party access and SaaS integrations (OAuth apps, API keys, service accounts).</li></ul>\r\n\r\nExample: If a finance mailbox can approve payments, verify that the account has MFA, that sign-ins are logged, and that mailbox forwarding rules are restricted and monitored.\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"patching-and-configuration\">Patching and configuration</h3>\r\n<ul><li>Track patch status for OS, browsers, VPN clients, and key apps.</li><li>Ensure unsupported systems are identified and either upgraded or isolated.</li><li>Confirm configuration baselines for endpoints/servers: firewall on, disk encryption, secure remote management.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nExample: If you use remote access tools, audit whether they’re restricted to corporate-managed devices and whether logs are retained.\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"backups-and-recovery\">Backups and recovery</h3>\r\n<ul><li>Validate the “3-2-1” idea (multiple copies, multiple media, one offline/immutable if possible) in principle, even if implementation is simple.</li><li>Ensure backups include SaaS data you rely on (email, file shares, CRM exports).</li><li>Run restore tests and document outcomes.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nExample: Don’t just confirm that backups run—restore a file and a system image to verify speed and integrity.\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"logging-and-detection\">Logging and detection</h3>\r\n<ul><li>Centralize at least critical logs: identity provider sign-ins, endpoint alerts, firewall/VPN logs.</li><li>Ensure alerting is actionable and routed to a monitored channel.</li><li>Define “minimum viable monitoring” for SMEs: account lockouts, impossible travel alerts (if available), new admin creation, suspicious inbox rules, ransomware/EDR high-severity alerts.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nExample: If alerts go to an unmonitored mailbox, you effectively have no detection.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"4-turn-findings-into-a-realistic-remediation-plan\">4) Turn findings into a realistic remediation plan</h2>\r\nThe audit is only useful if it drives measurable improvements. Keep the output short and operational.\r\n\r\nA practical way to rank findings:\r\n<ul><li>Severity: What’s the impact if exploited (data loss, financial fraud, downtime)?</li><li>Likelihood: Is it exposed to the internet? Is it common attack path? Is it already happening (alerts)?</li><li>Effort: Low (hours), Medium (days), High (weeks/months).</li></ul>\r\n\r\nWrite findings in a format your team can execute:\r\n<ul><li>“Issue: MFA not enforced for legacy email access.</li></ul>\r\n  - Risk: Account takeover via password spraying.\r\n  - Evidence: Legacy protocol enabled; users can sign in without MFA.\r\n  - Fix: Disable legacy auth; enforce MFA; monitor failed sign-ins.\r\n  - Owner: IT Manager.\r\n  - Due: 30 days.\r\n  - Verify: Test sign-in; review sign-in logs.”\r\n\r\nAim for quick wins first:\r\n<ul><li>Disable unused accounts and stale admin privileges.</li><li>Enforce MFA everywhere.</li><li>Patch internet-facing systems.</li><li>Run a restore test.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"checklist\">Checklist</h2>\r\nUse these 30 questions as your audit runbook. Answer each with evidence and capture an action if the answer is “No” or “Not sure.”\r\n\r\n<ul><li>[ ] Scope: Have you defined the in-scope systems, networks, and critical data stores?</li><li>[ ] Scope: Do you know your top 5 “crown jewel” datasets and who owns each?</li><li>[ ] Inventory: Do you have an up-to-date inventory of endpoints, servers, and key SaaS apps?</li><li>[ ] Inventory: Can you identify all internet-facing services (VPN, remote access, web apps)?</li><li>[ ] Identity: Is MFA enforced for all users (not just admins) on your primary identity/email platform?</li><li>[ ] Identity: Are admin privileges minimized and reviewed at least quarterly?</li><li>[ ] Identity: Do admins use separate accounts for privileged tasks (no daily-driver admin)?</li><li>[ ] Identity: Are shared accounts avoided, or if unavoidable, controlled with strong compensating controls?</li><li>[ ] Access: Is there a documented joiner/mover/leaver process with timely deprovisioning?</li><li>[ ] Access: Are third-party/vendor accounts reviewed and removed when no longer needed?</li><li>[ ] Email: Are mailbox forwarding rules restricted and periodically reviewed?</li><li>[ ] Endpoint: Are corporate endpoints encrypted (full disk) and protected with a host firewall?</li><li>[ ] Endpoint: Do you have a standard build/baseline (secure configuration) for endpoints?</li><li>[ ] Endpoint: Is there an endpoint protection/detection capability deployed on all managed devices?</li><li>[ ] Patching: Do you have a patch policy with timelines (e.g., critical within days/weeks) and proof of execution?</li><li>[ ] Patching: Are unsupported OS/applications identified, tracked, and actively remediated?</li><li>[ ] Network: Is remote access (VPN/RDP/remote tools) restricted, monitored, and protected by MFA?</li><li>[ ] Network: Are default passwords removed and device management interfaces not exposed to the internet?</li><li>[ ] Data: Is sensitive data classified or at least labeled by type and location (even informally)?</li><li>[ ] Data: Are file shares/cloud storage permissions reviewed for excessive access (e.g., “Everyone”)?</li><li>[ ] Data: Are secrets (API keys, passwords) stored in approved locations (not spreadsheets/email)?</li><li>[ ] Backups: Do backups cover critical servers and critical SaaS data (email/files/CRM as applicable)?</li><li>[ ] Backups: Are backups protected from deletion/tampering (separate credentials, offline/immutable where possible)?</li><li>[ ] Backups: Have you performed and documented a restore test in the last 90 days?</li><li>[ ] Logging: Are sign-in logs, admin changes, and endpoint alerts retained and reviewable?</li><li>[ ] Logging: Do alerts go to a monitored channel with an on-call/backup contact?</li><li>[ ] Incident readiness: Do you have an incident response checklist with key contacts and steps?</li><li>[ ] Incident readiness: Have you run a tabletop exercise in the last year (even 30 minutes)?</li><li>[ ] Change control: Are major changes (new SaaS, new firewall rules, new admins) recorded and approved?</li><li>[ ] Risk: Do you maintain a simple risk register with owners and remediation dates for top findings?</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"faq\">FAQ</h2>\r\n<strong>1) How often should an SME run a security audit like this?</strong>\r\nQuarterly is a practical cadence, plus after major changes (new systems, mergers, big network changes) or after an incident.\r\n\r\n<strong>2) What’s the difference between an audit and a vulnerability scan?</strong>\r\nA vulnerability scan finds technical weaknesses; an audit checks whether key security controls and processes exist, work, and are evidenced.\r\n\r\n<strong>3) Do I need to follow NIST, ISO, or CIS to use this checklist?</strong>\r\nNo. You can use this as a baseline; if you later align to NIST/ISO/CIS, this evidence and process will still help without claiming compliance."
