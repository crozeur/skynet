  "content": "<h2 id=\"intro\">Intro</h2>\nSecurity audits don’t have to be painful, expensive, or reserved for large enterprises. For SMEs, the goal is simple: quickly verify that the security basics are actually working, and that the riskiest gaps are visible and owned. This post gives you a lightweight approach you can run quarterly (and before major changes) without claiming “compliance.” Use it to gather evidence, spot high-impact fixes, and create a short, trackable action plan.\n<h2 id=\"quick-take\">Quick take</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Define scope and “crown jewels” first, or you’ll audit everything and learn nothing.</li>\n<li>Ask for evidence (screenshots, logs, configs, tickets), not promises.</li>\n<li>Prioritize identity, patching, backups, and monitoring—most SME incidents start there.</li>\n<li>Turn findings into owners, due dates, and verification steps.</li>\n<li>Repeat on a cadence (quarterly) and after major changes (new SaaS, M&A, new firewall).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"1-set-the-audit-scope-systems-data-and-acceptable-risk\">1) Set the audit scope: systems, data, and acceptable risk</h2>\nA good SME audit starts with boundaries. If you don’t define what matters most, your checklist becomes a long list of “nice-to-haves” and your team loses momentum.\nPractical steps:\n<ol>\n<li>List your critical business services (e.g., email, file storage, ERP/finance, customer database, e-commerce, remote access). These are your primary audit targets.</li>\n<li>Identify your “crown jewel” data types: customer PII, payment data, credentials/secrets, intellectual property, financial records.</li>\n<li>Map where that data lives: endpoints, servers, SaaS apps, cloud storage, on-prem shares.</li>\n<li>Define risk tolerance in plain language. Example: “We accept brief outages for internal tools, but not for billing; we can tolerate low-risk data exposure, but not customer PII.”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Example: If your customer database is in a SaaS CRM and your staff authenticate via a single identity provider, your audit should spend more time on identity controls (MFA, conditional access, logging) than on local server hardening.</p>\nDeliverable to produce:\n<ul>\n<li>A one-page scope document: in-scope apps, networks, user groups, and a short “out of scope” list.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"2-collect-evidence-efficiently-and-avoid-checkbox-theater\">2) Collect evidence efficiently (and avoid checkbox theater)</h2>\nAudits fail when they rely on verbal assurances: “Yes, we do backups.” Your goal is to collect lightweight evidence that a control exists and is effective.\nEvidence types that work well for SMEs:\n<ul>\n<li>Screenshots of key settings (MFA enforced, password policy, device encryption).</li>\n<li>Exported lists (admin accounts, MFA enrollment report, list of SaaS integrations).</li>\n<li>Sample logs (sign-in logs, endpoint alerts, firewall denies) covering the last 7–30 days.</li>\n<li>Tickets or change records showing patching, access approvals, and incidents.</li>\n</ul>\nHow to sample without boiling the ocean:\n<ul>\n<li>Pick a representative sample: 10–20 endpoints, 3–5 critical servers, 5–10 key SaaS apps.</li>\n<li>Sample by risk: executives, finance, IT admins, and remote users first.</li>\n<li>Validate “control works” by testing. Example: attempt to log in to a test account without MFA; confirm it is blocked.</li>\n</ul>\nExample “evidence request” you can send internally:\n<ul>\n<li>“Provide the list of accounts with global admin privileges and proof of MFA enforcement.”</li>\n<li>“Provide the last successful restore test record (date, system, result).”</li>\n<li>“Provide the patch report showing OS and browser patch status for all managed endpoints.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"3-audit-the-controls-that-stop-real-world-sme-incidents\">3) Audit the controls that stop real-world SME incidents</h2>\nMost SME compromises trace back to a small set of control failures: weak identity hygiene, exposed remote access, unpatched systems, poor backups, and limited detection.\n<p>Below are practical audit themes and what “good” looks like—without overcomplicating it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"identity-and-access-especially-admins\">Identity and access (especially admins)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure MFA is required for all users, and stronger requirements exist for admins.</li>\n<li>Reduce the number of admin accounts; use separate admin identities for privileged work.</li>\n<li>Review third-party access and SaaS integrations (OAuth apps, API keys, service accounts).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: If a finance mailbox can approve payments, verify that the account has MFA, that sign-ins are logged, and that mailbox forwarding rules are restricted and monitored.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patching-and-configuration\">Patching and configuration</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Track patch status for OS, browsers, VPN clients, and key apps.</li>\n<li>Ensure unsupported systems are identified and either upgraded or isolated.</li>\n<li>Confirm configuration baselines for endpoints/servers: firewall on, disk encryption, secure remote management.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: If you use remote access tools, audit whether they’re restricted to corporate-managed devices and whether logs are retained.</p>\n<h3 id=\"backups-and-recovery\">Backups and recovery</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Validate the “3-2-1” idea (multiple copies, multiple media, one offline/immutable if possible) in principle, even if implementation is simple.</li>\n<li>Ensure backups include SaaS data you rely on (email, file shares, CRM exports).</li>\n<li>Run restore tests and document outcomes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: Don’t just confirm that backups run—restore a file and a system image to verify speed and integrity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"logging-and-detection\">Logging and detection</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Centralize at least critical logs: identity provider sign-ins, endpoint alerts, firewall/VPN logs.</li>\n<li>Ensure alerting is actionable and routed to a monitored channel.</li>\n<li>Define “minimum viable monitoring” for SMEs: account lockouts, impossible travel alerts (if available), new admin creation, suspicious inbox rules, ransomware/EDR high-severity alerts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: If alerts go to an unmonitored mailbox, you effectively have no detection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-turn-findings-into-a-realistic-remediation-plan\">4) Turn findings into a realistic remediation plan</h2>\nThe audit is only useful if it drives measurable improvements.
