  "content": "<h2 id=\"intro\">Intro</h2>\r\nSmall and mid-sized businesses often get the same handful of security alerts, but the difference between “noise” and “incident” comes down to process. A lightweight SOC playbook helps you make consistent decisions under time pressure, even if your team is small or part-time. This post gives you practical triage steps, evidence to collect, and clear escalation triggers for common SME alerts. Use it to reduce panic, cut alert fatigue, and preserve the data you’ll need if something is truly wrong.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"quick-take\">Quick take</h2>\r\n<ul>\n<li>Triage is a repeatable decision process: confirm, scope, contain, and document before you “fix.”</li>\n<li>Always capture minimum evidence first (timestamps, affected assets, identities, and relevant logs).</li>\n<li>Use severity levels tied to business impact and confidence, not just the tool’s “critical” label.</li>\n<li>Define escalation triggers in advance (e.g., privileged accounts, ransomware indicators, widespread impact).</li>\n<li>Close the loop: label outcomes, tune detections, and update playbooks after every meaningful case.</li>\n</ul>\n\r\n<h2 id=\"1-triage-workflow-confirm-scope-contain-decide\">1) Triage workflow: confirm → scope → contain → decide</h2>\r\nA practical SME-friendly triage loop can be summarized in four phases. Keep it simple enough that any on-call engineer can follow it.\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"step-a-confirm-the-alert-is-real-and-not-misfired\">Step A: Confirm the alert is real (and not misfired)</h3>\r\nGoal: decide whether the alert corresponds to an actual event on your systems.\r\n\r\nActions:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the source: endpoint agent, email gateway, firewall, cloud audit logs, identity provider, etc.</li>\n<li>Validate key fields: affected host/user, time window, detection reason, and raw event IDs if available.</li>\n<li>Check for obvious false positives: known scanner IPs, scheduled admin scripts, patching activity, vulnerability scans, or legitimate travel.</li>\n</ul>\n\r\nExample: A “suspicious PowerShell” alert may be legitimate if it matches your known software deployment job. Confirm by comparing the parent process, script path, and the signed publisher (if applicable).\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"step-b-scope-the-blast-radius\">Step B: Scope the blast radius</h3>\r\nGoal: understand “how big” before you take actions that erase evidence.\r\n\r\nActions:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Determine whether it’s one user/host or multiple.</li>\n<li>Identify related events in the same timeframe: authentication logs, process execution, outbound connections, mailbox rules, file modifications.</li>\n<li>Look for lateral movement indicators: new admin group membership, remote service creation, repeated failed logons, unusual SMB/RDP activity.</li>\n</ul>\n\r\nExample: If a user clicked a phishing link, scope includes: the user’s mailbox activity, sign-in logs for that account, and any downloads/executions on their endpoint.\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"step-c-contain-safely-dont-destroy-evidence\">Step C: Contain safely (don’t destroy evidence)</h3>\r\nGoal: stop ongoing harm while preserving what you may need for response.\r\n\r\nActions (choose the least disruptive option that works):\r\n<ul>\n<li>Disable or reset credentials if compromise is likely.</li>\n<li>Isolate a host from the network rather than powering it off.</li>\n<li>Block a domain/IP only after verifying it’s not business-critical.</li>\n<li>Quarantine emails and remove similar messages from inboxes.</li>\n</ul>\n\r\nRule of thumb: if you might need forensics later, avoid “cleanup first.” Preserve logs, disk images, and relevant cloud audit trails if feasible.\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"step-d-decide-close-monitor-or-escalate\">Step D: Decide: close, monitor, or escalate</h3>\r\nYour outcome should land in one of these buckets:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Close as false positive (with a note explaining why).</li>\n<li>Close as benign/expected (document the change and consider tuning).</li>\n<li>Monitor (insufficient confidence; set a time-bound follow-up).</li>\n<li>Escalate to incident response (meets severity or trigger criteria).</li>\n</ul>\n\r\n<h2 id=\"2-severity-and-escalation-model-built-for-smes\">2) Severity and escalation model built for SMEs</h2>\r\nMany SMEs struggle because every “high” alert feels like a crisis.
