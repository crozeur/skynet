  "content": "<h2 id=\"intro\">Intro</h2>\nSmall IT teams don’t fail because they lack tools—they fail because every alert looks urgent at 2 a.m. A simple, repeatable triage workflow helps you separate noise from real risk, respond consistently, and keep operations running. This post outlines a lightweight SOC-style alert triage process you can run with limited staff, whether your alerts come from a SIEM, EDR, email security, cloud logs, or an MSSP. The goal is not perfection; it’s a reliable path from “alert fired” to “handled and learned.”\n<h2 id=\"quick-take\">Quick take</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Treat triage as a funnel: reduce many alerts into a few verified incidents.</li>\n<li>Decide severity using business impact + confidence, not just scary alert names.</li>\n<li>Use a minimum evidence set so any team member can validate quickly.</li>\n<li>Contain first when there’s credible risk; investigate deeper after blast radius stops growing.</li>\n<li>Document every decision with timestamps and artifacts to improve detection and reduce repeat noise.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"1-define-what-triage-means-and-what-it-doesnt\">1) Define what “triage” means (and what it doesn’t)</h2>\nTriage is the rapid decision step between “an alert happened” and “we’re doing incident response.” In small environments, it’s easy to skip triage and either (a) ignore alerts until something breaks, or (b) treat every alert like a breach. Both approaches burn time and increase risk.\nA practical definition:\n<ul>\n<li>Triage answers three questions fast:</li>\n</ul>\n  1) Is this likely real (or likely noise)?\n  2) If real, how bad could it be for us?\n  3) What is the safest next action right now?\nWhat triage is not:\n<ul>\n<li>Not a full forensic investigation.</li>\n<li>Not a compliance exercise.</li>\n<li>Not a hunt for root cause when the system might still be actively compromised.</li>\n</ul>\nRoles for small teams (keep it simple):\n<ul>\n<li>Triage owner (on duty): makes the initial call, runs the checklist.</li>\n<li>System owner: confirms business context (is this server critical? is this user traveling?).</li>\n<li>Approver (optional): if triage suggests a disruptive containment action (disabling accounts, isolating devices), get quick approval unless policy pre-authorizes it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tip: If you align with generic guidance like NIST/ISO/CIS, think of triage as a repeatable “detect → analyze → respond” decision point—without claiming compliance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-create-a-severity-model-your-team-can-apply-in-60-seconds\">2) Create a severity model your team can apply in 60 seconds</h2>\nSmall teams need a severity rubric that is easy to memorize and hard to misuse. Avoid complex scoring that requires perfect data.\nUse a two-axis model:\n<ul>\n<li>Business impact (High/Medium/Low)</li>\n<li>Confidence (High/Medium/Low)</li>\n</ul>\nThen map to a simple action:\n<ul>\n<li>High impact + high confidence: act now (contain immediately, then investigate).</li>\n<li>High impact + low confidence: gather minimum evidence fast; be ready to contain.</li>\n<li>Low impact + high confidence: schedule investigation; contain if it’s spreading.</li>\n<li>Low impact + low confidence: document and tune; don’t burn hours.</li>\n</ul>\nExamples of impact (context matters):\n<ul>\n<li>High impact: domain admin activity, finance system access, backups being modified, privileged cloud roles changed, multiple endpoints showing similar behavior.</li>\n<li>Medium impact: a single workstation malware detection, suspicious login to an internal app, new service installation on a server that isn’t critical.</li>\n<li>Low impact: a blocked phishing email, a single failed login burst against a non-privileged account with MFA enabled.</li>\n</ul>\nExamples of confidence:\n<ul>\n<li>High confidence: correlated signals (EDR process + unusual network + user report), known-bad hash from your EDR, verified impossible travel with no VPN.</li>\n<li>Medium confidence: single strong signal without corroboration (e.g., “suspicious PowerShell” without file/network evidence).</li>\n<li>Low confidence: generic IDS signature, noisy anomaly alerts without supporting telemetry.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Operational rule: If you can’t explain in one sentence why it’s high severity, it isn’t—yet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-the-triage-workflow-from-alert-to-decision-in-1530-minutes\">3) The triage workflow: from alert to decision in 15–30 minutes</h2>\nHere’s a workflow that fits small teams and can be run as a playbook. The steps below assume you have at least basic log access (SIEM queries, cloud audit logs, EDR console, email gateway), but the logic works even if you’re piecing together data manually.\n<h3 id=\"step-1-capture-the-alert-package-25-minutes\">Step 1: Capture the alert package (2–5 minutes)</h3>\nBefore clicking around, collect:\n<ul>\n<li>Alert ID, source, timestamp (and time zone)</li>\n<li>Affected asset(s): hostname, IP, cloud resource, user account</li>\n<li>Detection name and raw event details</li>\n<li>Initial severity from the tool (but don’t trust it blindly)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Create a ticket immediately. Even if it’s noise, you want traceability and a place to store artifacts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"step-2-do-the-minimum-evidence-set-510-minutes\">Step 2: Do the “minimum evidence set” (5–10 minutes)</h3>\nAim for fast validation using the smallest set of checks that reliably increases confidence.\nMinimum evidence set (choose what fits the alert type):\n<ul>\n<li>Identity: last successful login, MFA status, recent password reset, new device/session, geolocation change</li>\n<li>Endpoint: process tree (parent/child), file path, command line, signer reputation, user context</li>\n<li>Network: outbound connections (domain/IP), unusual ports, DNS queries, data volume spikes</li>\n<li>Email: message headers, sender auth results (SPF/DKIM/DMARC outcomes if available), URLs clicked, attachments opened</li>\n<li>Cloud: audit trail for resource changes (role assignment, key creation, mailbox forwarding rules)</li>\n</ul>\nExample: “Suspicious PowerShell” on a workstation\n<ul>\n<li>Check command line: is it a known admin script path, or an encoded command?</li>\n<li>Check parent process: launched from Explorer (user click) or from Office (macro), or from a scheduled task?</li>\n<li>Check network: did it contact an external IP or download a payload?</li>\n<li>Check user: did the user report opening an unexpected file?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If two or more signals point the same direction, raise confidence.</p>\n<h3 id=\"step-3-classify-and-decide-action-25-minutes\">Step 3: Classify and decide action (2–5 minutes)</h3>\nPut it into one of three buckets:\n<ul>\n<li>False positive/no action: document why and tune later.</li>\n<li>Suspicious/needs investigation: assign investigation tasks with a timebox.</li>\n<li>Likely incident: contain now.</li>\n</ul>\nWrite a clear decision note:\n<ul>\n<li>“Classified as Likely Incident because: X, Y, Z.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"step-4-contain-when-credible-risk-exists-510-minutes\">Step 4: Contain when credible risk exists (5–10 minutes)</h3>\nContainment should be reversible and targeted where possible.\nCommon containment actions:\n<ul>\n<li>Disable or reset a compromised user account; revoke sessions/tokens</li>\n<li>Isolate an endpoint from the network (EDR isolation if you have it; otherwise VLAN/quarantine)</li>\n<li>Block a domain/IP temporarily at firewall/DNS security</li>\n<li>Remove malicious mailbox rules or forwarding; quarantine messages</li>\n<li>Freeze sensitive changes: stop scheduled tasks, disable newly created service accounts, pause suspicious cloud keys</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rule of thumb: if the alert involves privileged access or lateral movement indicators, containment is usually the right first move.</p>\n<h3 id=\"step-5-handoff-to-investigation-and-track-sla\">Step 5: Handoff to investigation and track SLA</h3>\nAfter containment (or after classification as “suspicious”), define:\n<ul>\n<li>Owner</li>\n<li>Next check(s)</li>\n<li>Deadline (even if it’s “by end of day”)</li>\n<li>What will close the ticket (evidence of benign cause, or incident declared)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Timeboxing matters.

The workflow is tool-agnostic; you just collect the minimum evidence from whatever consoles and logs you have, then make a consistent decision.</p>\n<p><strong>Q3: How do we know when to declare an incident?</strong>\nDeclare an incident when you have credible evidence of unauthorized access, malware execution with persistence, data exposure risk, or privilege misuse—especially on critical assets or admin accounts.</p>"
