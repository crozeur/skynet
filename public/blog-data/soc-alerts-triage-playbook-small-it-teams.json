A simple, consistent triage playbook helps you sort “needs action now” from “can wait” without burning out your team. This post gives you a repeatable workflow you can run with a basic SIEM/EDR plus your existing IT processes. The goal isn’t perfection; it’s faster, safer decisions with clear handoffs.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"quick-take\">Quick take</h2>\r\n<ul>\n<li>Treat triage as a time-boxed decision: escalate, contain, monitor, or close.</li>\n<li>Use a consistent severity model based on business impact, exposure, and confidence.</li>\n<li>Start with context (asset, user, baseline behavior) before deep forensics.</li>\n<li>Standardize evidence capture and notes so anyone can pick up the case.</li>\n<li>Reduce noise continuously by tuning rules, enriching data, and fixing root causes.</li>\n</ul>\n\r\n<h2 id=\"1-set-a-clear-triage-objective-and-time-boxes\">1) Set a clear triage objective and time boxes</h2>\r\nTriage is not the full investigation. It’s a structured, short process to decide what to do next.\r\n\r\nDefine four possible outcomes for every alert:\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Escalate</strong>: This likely represents malicious activity and needs deeper investigation or incident response.</li>\n<li><strong>Contain</strong>: Take immediate action to reduce risk (isolate host, disable account, block hash/IP) while you investigate.</li>\n<li><strong>Monitor</strong>: Not enough evidence yet; keep under watch with specific follow-ups.</li>\n<li><strong>Close</strong>: Benign, duplicate, or explained by known change.</li>\n</ol>\n\r\nSuggested time boxes (adapt to your capacity):\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Initial triage (5–15 minutes):</strong> Identify what fired, what asset/user is involved, and whether there’s immediate risk.</li>\n<li><strong>Rapid validation (15–45 minutes):</strong> Gather minimal evidence to support a decision and pick the outcome.</li>\n<li><strong>Escalation handoff (10 minutes):</strong> If escalating, document what you know and what you already checked.</li>\n</ul>\n\r\nPractical example (small team reality):\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Alert: “Multiple failed logins followed by successful login” for an employee mailbox.</li>\n<li>Initial triage: Check if the source IP is unusual, whether MFA was used, and whether the account is privileged.</li>\n<li>Rapid validation: Look for impossible travel, new inbox rules, unusual OAuth consents, or sign-ins from atypical user agents.</li>\n<li>Outcome: If high confidence or high impact (executive mailbox, finance), contain (reset password, revoke sessions) and escalate.</li>\n</ul>\n\r\nKey principle: if you can’t finish triage quickly, that’s a signal to <strong>escalate or contain</strong>, not to spend hours in limbo.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"2-use-a-simple-severity-model-you-can-apply-consistently\">2) Use a simple severity model you can apply consistently</h2>\r\nMany alerting systems assign “high/medium/low,” but triage needs a severity model that reflects your business.\r\n\r\nUse three inputs:\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact (business harm if true):</strong> privileged account, sensitive system, customer data, financial operations, production uptime.</li>\n<li><strong>Exposure (blast radius):</strong> internet-facing, shared accounts, domain admin, widely deployed software, lateral movement potential.</li>\n<li><strong>Confidence (how likely it’s real):</strong> strong telemetry + corroboration vs. one weak signal.</li>\n</ul>\n\r\nA practical scoring approach (no math required):\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>P1 (Urgent):</strong> High impact OR high exposure with moderate/high confidence. Immediate containment or escalation.</li>\n<li><strong>P2 (Important):</strong> Moderate impact/exposure with moderate confidence. Investigate within same business day.</li>\n<li><strong>P3 (Routine):</strong> Low impact/exposure or low confidence. Monitor, tune, or close with documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>P1:</strong> “EDR reports credential dumping behavior” on a domain controller.</li>\n<li><strong>P2:</strong> “New scheduled task created” on a workstation used by IT staff, but no other indicators.</li>\n<li><strong>P3:</strong> “Port scan detected” against a non-production host behind VPN with a known vulnerability scan window.</li>\n</ul>\n\r\nTo keep decisions consistent, document “what makes this P1/P2/P3” in two or three sentences in your playbook. Consistency matters more than the perfect model.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"3-triage-workflow-the-minimum-evidence-set-mes\">3) Triage workflow: the minimum evidence set (MES)</h2>\r\nThe biggest time sink in small SOC operations is chasing details before you have context. Start with a minimum evidence set you collect for every alert. Make it a template so you’re not improvising.\r\n\r\nMinimum Evidence Set (collect what applies):\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Alert metadata:</strong> rule name, detection source (SIEM/EDR/email), timestamp, severity, correlation IDs.</li>\n<li><strong>Asset context:</strong> hostname, IP, owner/team, business function, criticality, OS, location/network segment.</li>\n<li><strong>User context:</strong> username, role, department, privilege level, recent changes (new device, password reset, role change).</li>\n<li><strong>Baseline comparison:</strong> is this new for the asset/user? (new process, new country, new admin tool).</li>\n<li><strong>Related activity window:</strong> 30–60 minutes before and after the alert (logins, process creation, network connections).</li>\n<li><strong>Immediate risk check:</strong> signs of persistence, credential access, lateral movement, or data access.</li>\n</ol>\n\r\nPractical example: suspected malware execution alert\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Start: Identify the process name, parent process, command line, and hash.</li>\n<li>Context: Is this a server running line-of-business apps? Who owns it? Is it a kiosk?</li>\n<li>Baseline: Has this binary run before on this device fleet?</li>\n<li>Corroboration: Any DNS to newly seen domains, unusual outbound connections, or file writes to startup locations?</li>\n<li>Decision: If it’s a known admin tool executed by IT during a change window, close or monitor with a note. If it’s a user-launched binary from Downloads plus suspicious network calls, contain and escalate.</li>\n</ul>\n\r\nTip for small teams: if you can only automate one thing, automate <strong>enrichment</strong> (asset criticality, user privilege, known change windows) so triage has context immediately.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"4-containment-first-actions-that-wont-break-your-environment\">4) Containment-first actions that won’t break your environment</h2>\r\nSmall IT teams often delay containment because they fear business disruption. The solution is to pre-approve safe containment options by scenario.\r\n\r\nCreate a “containment menu” with guardrails:\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Account actions:</strong> force password reset, revoke sessions/tokens, disable account temporarily, require MFA re-registration.</li>\n<li><strong>Endpoint actions:</strong> isolate host from network (EDR), block execution by hash, quarantine file, kill process.</li>\n<li><strong>Network actions:</strong> block IP/domain temporarily (with expiration), add DNS sinkhole entry, restrict egress for a host segment.</li>\n<li><strong>Email actions:</strong> purge message, block sender/domain, remove malicious inbox rules.</li>\n</ul>\n\r\nGuardrails to reduce accidental outages:\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Time-bound blocks (e.g., 4–24 hours) unless confirmed malicious.</li>\n<li>Always capture evidence (screenshots/log exports) before destructive steps when feasible.</li>\n<li>Maintain an emergency contact list for business owners of critical systems.</li>\n<li>For critical servers, prefer “contain at the account/network layer” before isolating the host.</li>\n</ul>\n\r\nExample: suspicious OAuth app consent (cloud identity)\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Contain: revoke the app’s permissions, revoke user sessions, reset password if necessary.</li>\n<li>Validate: check audit logs for consent grant, sign-in anomalies, mailbox rule changes.</li>\n<li>Escalate: if the app was granted broad scopes or multiple users are affected.</li>\n</ul>\n\r\nThe objective is to reduce risk quickly while you investigate—especially when confidence is high but details are still emerging.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"5-close-the-loop-documentation-tuning-and-root-cause-fixes\">5) Close the loop: documentation, tuning, and root-cause fixes</h2>\r\nIf your SOC workflow ends at “close alert,” you’ll relive the same noise every week. Use a lightweight closure routine that feeds improvement.\r\n\r\nFor every closed or resolved alert, capture:\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Disposition:</strong> true positive, false positive, benign true positive (expected but worth logging), or duplicate.</li>\n<li><strong>Why:</strong> one or two sentences referencing the evidence that supported the decision.</li>\n<li><strong>Action taken:</strong> containment steps, tickets opened, stakeholder notified.</li>\n<li><strong>Follow-up:</strong> tuning request, missing log source, endpoint hardening, user coaching, or policy update.</li>\n</ul>\n\r\nNoise reduction tactics that work for SMEs:\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fix data quality first:</strong> correct time sync, ensure key logs are onboarding properly, standardize hostnames.</li>\n<li><strong>Tune with intent:</strong> suppress alerts only with a documented reason and an expiration date.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce duplicates:</strong> deduplicate correlated alerts into a single “case” per asset/user per time window.</li>\n<li><strong>Address recurring causes:</strong> if “powershell suspicious” is constant due to IT scripts, sign scripts, use approved admin tooling, or narrow the detection to risky patterns.</li>\n</ul>\n\r\nFramework alignment (kept generic):\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>NIST/ISO/CIS-style programs all benefit from repeatable triage, clear incident categories, evidence handling, and continuous improvement—even if you’re not claiming compliance.</li>\n</ul>\n\r\n<h2 id=\"checklist\">Checklist</h2>\r\n<ul>\n<li>[ ] Define triage outcomes (escalate, contain, monitor, close) and make them mandatory for every alert</li>\n<li>[ ] Establish time boxes for initial triage and rapid validation</li>\n<li>[ ] Maintain an asset inventory with owner, criticality, and environment (prod/dev) tags for enrichment</li>\n<li>[ ] Tag privileged users and service accounts so identity-related alerts are prioritized correctly</li>\n<li>[ ] Create a Minimum Evidence Set template and store it in your ticketing system</li>\n<li>[ ] Pre-approve a containment menu with guardrails (time-bound blocks, evidence first)</li>\n<li>[ ] Build a simple P1/P2/P3 severity model using impact, exposure, and confidence</li>\n<li>[ ] Require a short “why” note for closures (evidence-based) to prevent repeat work</li>\n<li>[ ] Track top recurring alert types weekly and assign a tuning/root-cause owner</li>\n<li>[ ] Add escalation paths and after-hours contacts for critical systems and executives</li>\n</ul>\n\r\n<h2 id=\"faq\">FAQ</h2>\r\n<strong>1) How do we triage alerts if we only have one person on security?</strong>\r\nUse strict time boxes and a containment-first approach for high-impact alerts. Standardize your evidence template so another IT teammate can step in when needed.\r\n\r\n<strong>2) When should we contain immediately instead of investigating more?</strong>\r\nContain when potential impact is high (privileged access, sensitive systems) or when you have multiple corroborating signals. You can always roll back time-bound containment if it’s benign.\r\n\r\n<strong>3) What’s the fastest way to reduce alert fatigue?</strong>\r\nImprove enrichment and close-loop tuning: add asset/user context to every alert, deduplicate into cases, and fix the root causes behind repeat false positives."
