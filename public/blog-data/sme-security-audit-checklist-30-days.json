  "content": "<h2 id=\"intro\">Intro</h2>\nA security audit doesn’t have to be a massive, expensive project to be valuable. For most SMEs, the goal is to quickly find the biggest gaps, reduce obvious risk, and build a repeatable process. This 30-day checklist focuses on practical reviews you can complete with limited time and staff. You’ll end the month with clearer visibility, prioritized fixes, and documentation you can reuse.\n<h2 id=\"quick-take\">Quick take</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on visibility first: assets, accounts, and data flows before tools.</li>\n<li>Fix high-risk basics fast: MFA, patching, backups, and admin access.</li>\n<li>Use evidence, not assumptions: screenshots, exports, and configuration notes.</li>\n<li>Review third-party access and data handling as carefully as internal systems.</li>\n<li>Finish with an action plan: owners, deadlines, and a re-audit cadence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"week-1-set-scope-inventory-what-you-have-and-map-key-data\">Week 1: Set scope, inventory what you have, and map key data</h2>\nA 30-day audit succeeds or fails based on scope and inventory. If you don’t know what systems and data exist, you can’t assess risk realistically.\n<h3 id=\"1-define-scope-and-crown-jewels\">1) Define scope and “crown jewels”</h3>\nStart with a short scope statement (one page is fine):\n<ul>\n<li>In-scope: endpoints (laptops/desktops), servers, cloud services (email, file storage, CRM), network gear, and key SaaS apps.</li>\n<li>Out-of-scope (for now): legacy systems that aren’t business-critical, R&D labs, or any environment you truly can’t access—just note them.</li>\n<li>Crown jewels: the data and systems that would hurt the most if leaked or unavailable (customer PII, accounting, payroll, email, shared drives, production systems).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: If you’re a 50-person professional services firm, email + file sharing + accounting are often higher priority than internal wiki tooling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-build-a-lightweight-asset-inventory\">2) Build a lightweight asset inventory</h3>\nYou don’t need a perfect CMDB. You need a usable list:\n<ul>\n<li>Devices: type, owner, OS, location, encryption status, endpoint protection status.</li>\n<li>Servers/workloads: purpose, OS, patch cadence, who administers them.</li>\n<li>Cloud/SaaS: what it is, who owns it internally, admin accounts, integrations.</li>\n</ul>\nPractical approach:\n<ul>\n<li>Export device lists from your MDM (if you have one) and directory (e.g., your identity provider).</li>\n<li>For small shops without tooling, start with purchase records + DHCP leases + a quick staff survey.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"3-identify-your-critical-data-flows\">3) Identify your critical data flows</h3>\nDocument (even as a simple diagram or bullet list):\n<ul>\n<li>Where sensitive data is created (e.g., web forms, sales intake).</li>\n<li>Where it’s stored (cloud drive, CRM, accounting).</li>\n<li>Who can access it (teams, contractors).</li>\n<li>How it leaves the company (email, exports, third-party tools).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: “Leads captured on website → CRM → exported weekly to spreadsheet → shared via email” is a common risk chain worth tightening.</p>\n<h2 id=\"week-2-review-identity-access-and-administrative-control\">Week 2: Review identity, access, and administrative control</h2>\nMost SME incidents involve compromised accounts. Week 2 is about controlling who can log in and what they can do.\n<h3 id=\"1-establish-access-control-principles\">1) Establish access control principles</h3>\nUse generic best practices aligned with frameworks like NIST, ISO 27001, or CIS Controls—without claiming compliance:\n<ul>\n<li>Least privilege: users only get what they need.</li>\n<li>Separate admin accounts: avoid daily-use accounts being admins.</li>\n<li>Strong authentication: MFA everywhere it’s supported.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2-audit-accounts-and-privileges\">2) Audit accounts and privileges</h3>\nDo these reviews with evidence (exports, screenshots, or configuration notes):\n<ul>\n<li>List all users and admins in your identity system.</li>\n<li>Identify shared accounts (including “info@”, “admin@”, and vendor logins).</li>\n<li>Check for orphaned accounts (ex-employees, old contractors).</li>\n</ul>\nExample findings and fixes:\n<ul>\n<li>Finding: Two IT staff use their daily accounts as global admins.</li>\n</ul>\n  Fix: Create separate admin accounts and require MFA + conditional access.\n<ul>\n<li>Finding: A contractor still has access to the shared drive after project end.</li>\n</ul>\n  Fix: Remove access and add an offboarding checklist.\n<h3 id=\"3-confirm-mfa-coverage-and-recovery-paths\">3) Confirm MFA coverage and recovery paths</h3>\nIt’s not enough to “have MFA.” Validate:\n<ul>\n<li>Which apps enforce MFA (email, VPN, password manager, finance tools).</li>\n<li>Whether MFA is bypassable (legacy protocols, app passwords).</li>\n<li>Account recovery process (helpdesk resets, backup codes storage).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: If finance systems use email-based password resets, protect email as a top-tier asset and restrict who can reset finance accounts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-tighten-remote-access\">4) Tighten remote access</h3>\nIf you use VPN, remote desktop, or admin portals:\n<ul>\n<li>Restrict access by role and device posture where possible.</li>\n<li>Disable direct RDP from the internet.</li>\n<li>Review firewall rules and exposed services.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"week-3-patch-harden-and-back-up-for-resilience\">Week 3: Patch, harden, and back up for resilience</h2>\nWeek 3 focuses on reducing “easy wins” for attackers and ensuring you can recover.\n<h3 id=\"1-patch-management-reality-check\">1) Patch management reality check</h3>\nAssess patching for:\n<ul>\n<li>Operating systems (Windows/macOS/Linux)</li>\n<li>Browsers and common apps</li>\n<li>Server OS and key services</li>\n<li>Network devices (routers, firewalls)</li>\n</ul>\nPractical guidance:\n<ul>\n<li>Define patch SLAs by severity (e.g., critical faster than routine).</li>\n<li>Track exceptions: if you can’t patch a legacy system, isolate it and document compensating controls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: A line-of-business app can’t run on the latest OS. You keep it, but you segment it, restrict inbound access, and monitor logins.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-configuration-hardening-essentials\">2) Configuration hardening essentials</h3>\nYou can’t harden everything at once. Prioritize:\n<ul>\n<li>Endpoint encryption on laptops.</li>\n<li>Screen lock and inactivity timeouts.</li>\n<li>Disable local admin where possible.</li>\n<li>Secure baseline for email (block auto-forwarding externally, review suspicious mailbox rules).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: External auto-forwarding is often abused after account compromise. If you must allow it for a few roles, restrict it and review it monthly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-backups-you-can-actually-restore\">3) Backups you can actually restore</h3>\nAudit backups with three questions:\n<ul>\n<li>Are backups complete (all critical systems/data)?</li>\n<li>Are backups protected (separate credentials, immutable options if available)?</li>\n<li>Have you tested restore recently?</li>\n</ul>\nMinimum viable backup audit steps:\n<ul>\n<li>Pick 1–2 critical systems and perform a restore test to a safe location.</li>\n<li>Verify you can restore both data and access (e.g., encryption keys, admin credentials).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: A file share backup exists, but the restore requires a departing admin’s personal account. Fix by moving backup access to documented admin roles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"week-4-logging-vendors-and-incident-readiness\">Week 4: Logging, vendors, and incident readiness</h2>\nThe final week turns your findings into operational readiness: detect issues, manage supplier risk, and respond quickly.\n<h3 id=\"1-logging-and-monitoring-you-can-use\">1) Logging and monitoring you can use</h3>\nYou may not have a full SOC, but you should have:\n<ul>\n<li>Centralized logs for key systems (identity, email, endpoints, servers).</li>\n<li>Alerting for high-impact events: admin role changes, multiple failed logins, impossible travel, mailbox forwarding rules, disabled MFA.</li>\n</ul>\nPractical example:\n<ul>\n<li>If someone adds a new global admin at 2:00 AM, you want a notification the same day, not next quarter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2-review-third-party-and-saas-risk\">2) Review third-party and SaaS risk</h3>\nSMEs often outsource important functions. Do a vendor access and data handling review:\n<ul>\n<li>List vendors with access to your systems or sensitive data.</li>\n<li>Confirm who approved them and who owns the relationship.</li>\n<li>Review integrations (OAuth apps, API keys, service accounts).</li>\n<li>Confirm contract basics: breach notification, data retention, and offboarding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: A marketing tool connected to your email system with broad permissions. If it’s no longer needed, revoke OAuth access and remove API keys.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-validate-incident-response-basics\">3) Validate incident response basics</h3>\nYou don’t need a 40-page plan. You need a runnable playbook:\n<ul>\n<li>Roles: who decides, who communicates, who does technical containment.</li>\n<li>Contact list: IT, legal, insurer, critical vendors.</li>\n<li>First-hour steps: disable accounts, reset tokens, isolate devices, preserve logs.</li>\n<li>Communication: internal updates and customer messaging approval flow.</li>\n</ul>\nExample tabletop exercise (30 minutes):\n<ul>\n<li>Scenario: CFO mailbox compromise.</li>\n<li>Actions: reset MFA, revoke sessions, review mailbox rules, notify bank if wire fraud is possible, check recent sent items.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"4-turn-findings-into-a-prioritized-remediation-plan\">4) Turn findings into a prioritized remediation plan</h3>\nClose the audit with a short plan:\n<ul>\n<li>Top 5 risks (plain language).</li>\n<li>Fixes with owners and deadlines.</li>\n<li>Quick wins (1–2 weeks) vs. projects (30–90 days).</li>\n<li>Re-audit schedule (monthly for access reviews, quarterly for vendor/integration reviews, and after major changes).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"checklist\">Checklist</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[ ] Write a one-page audit scope and list your “crown jewel” systems/data.</li>\n<li>[ ] Create an asset inventory for devices, servers, and SaaS (owner + admin + purpose).</li>\n<li>[ ] Map key data flows for customer data, finance, and employee records.</li>\n<li>[ ] Export user and admin lists; remove orphaned accounts and document exceptions.</li>\n<li>[ ] Enforce MFA on email, identity, VPN, password manager, and finance tools; verify recovery methods.</li>\n<li>[ ] Separate daily-use and admin accounts; review shared/service accounts and rotate credentials.</li>\n<li>[ ] Review patch status for endpoints, servers, and network devices; define severity-based patch timelines.</li>\n<li>[ ] Confirm laptop encryption, screen-lock policies, and local admin controls.</li>\n<li>[ ] Verify backups cover critical systems; perform at least one restore test and document steps.</li>\n<li>[ ] Enable and review key security logs/alerts (identity changes, suspicious logins, forwarding rules).</li>\n<li>[ ] Inventory vendors/integrations with access to data; remove unused OAuth apps/API keys.</li>\n<li>[ ] Create a simple incident response playbook and run a short tabletop exercise.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"faq\">FAQ</h2>\nQ1: How do we do an audit if we don’t have a security team?\nA: Assign a single audit owner, use exports from existing systems (identity, email, MDM), and focus on the checklist items that reduce the most risk quickly.\n<p>Q2: Should we run vulnerability scans as part of this 30-day audit?\nA: If you already have a scanning tool, include it, but don’t let scanning replace basics like access control, patching discipline, and tested backups.</p>\n<p>Q3: What’s the most common “high impact” fix SMEs can make fast?\nA: Enforce MFA everywhere possible and reduce admin privileges—these two steps significantly cut down account-takeover risk.</p>",
