  "content": "<h2 id=\"intro\">Intro</h2>\nInternal security audits don’t have to be “big company” projects. For small IT teams, the goal is to confirm that everyday controls are actually working, not to produce a perfect report. A lightweight, repeatable audit helps you catch gaps before an attacker (or an outage) does. This post gives you a practical checklist and a simple way to run it quarterly—without buying new tools.\n<h2 id=\"quick-take\">Quick take</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on high-impact areas first: identity, patching, backups, and endpoint security.</li>\n<li>Audit what’s real, not what’s written: validate with spot checks and evidence.</li>\n<li>Keep scope small: pick a handful of systems and users each cycle.</li>\n<li>Track findings as tickets with owners and due dates, not as a static document.</li>\n<li>Re-audit closed items to confirm the fix actually reduced risk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"build-a-lightweight-audit-plan-scope-timing-evidence\">Build a lightweight audit plan (scope, timing, evidence)</h2>\nA small team can’t audit everything at once. Instead, define a tight scope and rotate.\n<h3 id=\"1-pick-a-cadence-you-can-sustain\">1) Pick a cadence you can sustain</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Monthly “mini-audit” (30–60 minutes): one topic (e.g., MFA coverage).</li>\n<li>Quarterly audit (half-day to one day): identity + patching + backups + endpoints.</li>\n<li>Annual deeper dive: vendor access, network segmentation, incident response tabletop.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2-define-the-audit-scope-in-one-paragraph\">2) Define the audit scope in one paragraph</h3>\nExample scope statement:\n“Review identity controls for Microsoft 365 and VPN, patch status for Windows endpoints and two critical servers, backup restore capability for the file share, and admin access to core systems.”\n<h3 id=\"3-decide-what-counts-as-evidence\">3) Decide what counts as evidence</h3>\nAvoid long narratives. Use simple, verifiable artifacts:\n<ul>\n<li>Screenshots of settings pages</li>\n<li>Exported user lists (admins, MFA status)</li>\n<li>Patch reports / update history</li>\n<li>Backup job logs plus a restore test record</li>\n<li>Ticket IDs for remediation actions</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"4-use-sampling-to-stay-sane\">4) Use sampling to stay sane</h3>\nIf you have 120 endpoints, don’t inspect all 120.\n<ul>\n<li>Sample 10 endpoints across departments</li>\n<li>Sample 10 user accounts (including at least 2 executives and 2 contractors)</li>\n<li>Sample 2 critical servers and 1 “forgotten” server</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Practical tip: Keep an “audit notebook” in a shared folder with dated subfolders. Store only what you need (and protect it—these artifacts can be sensitive).</p>\n<h2 id=\"identity-and-access-verify-the-controls-that-stop-most-breaches\">Identity and access: verify the controls that stop most breaches</h2>\nIdentity is the control plane for cloud apps, VPN, and admin tools. Small misconfigurations here can undo strong endpoint protection.\nWhat to check\n<h3 id=\"1-mfa-coverage-and-exceptions\">1) MFA coverage and exceptions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Verify MFA is enabled for all users, especially email and remote access.</li>\n<li>List any exceptions (service accounts, break-glass accounts) and confirm compensating controls.</li>\n</ul>\nExample evidence\n<ul>\n<li>Export from your IdP showing MFA status.</li>\n<li>A short note documenting why a service account can’t use MFA and how it’s protected (e.g., long random password in a vault, restricted sign-in locations).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2-admin-accounts-and-privilege-boundaries\">2) Admin accounts and privilege boundaries</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure admins use separate accounts for administrative tasks.</li>\n<li>Confirm least privilege: who is global admin, domain admin, local admin?</li>\n</ul>\nExample spot check\n<ul>\n<li>Pick two admins and confirm:</li>\n<li>Their day-to-day account is not an admin</li>\n<li>Admin account has MFA</li>\n<li>Admin sign-in logs show expected behavior</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"3-offboarding-and-contractor-access\">3) Offboarding and contractor access</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Validate a recent offboarding case end-to-end: account disabled, tokens revoked, groups removed, mailbox access handled, VPN removed.</li>\n</ul>\nExample\n<ul>\n<li>Choose one terminated user from the last 60 days. Confirm the disable timestamp and last successful login are aligned with policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"4-password-policy-and-account-recovery\">4) Password policy and account recovery</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Confirm password policy is reasonable and consistent.</li>\n<li>Review how users reset passwords (helpdesk workflow, identity verification).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Framework hint (generic)\nIf you map to CIS/NIST/ISO later, this identity work aligns with common access control and authentication control families—but don’t treat this audit as a “compliance” exercise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"systems-and-patching-prove-you-can-keep-up-with-known-vulnerabilities\">Systems and patching: prove you can keep up with known vulnerabilities</h2>\nPatching is where small teams get overwhelmed. The audit should surface bottlenecks and unmanaged assets.\nWhat to check\n<h3 id=\"1-asset-inventory-accuracy\">1) Asset inventory accuracy</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Can you produce a list of laptops, desktops, servers, and key SaaS admins?</li>\n<li>Identify unmanaged or unknown devices.</li>\n</ul>\nExample\n<ul>\n<li>Compare your endpoint management list to DHCP leases or your purchasing records. Any “ghost” devices are audit findings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2-patch-slas-service-level-targets\">2) Patch SLAs (service level targets)</h3>\nDefine simple targets (internal goals) and audit against them:\n<ul>\n<li>Critical security updates: within 14 days</li>\n<li>High: within 30 days</li>\n<li>Third-party apps (browsers, PDF readers): within 14–30 days</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No need to cite stats; just pick targets you can meet and improve.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-server-patching-and-reboot-reality\">3) Server patching and reboot reality</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Confirm servers actually reboot when needed.</li>\n<li>Validate maintenance windows exist and are used.</li>\n</ul>\nExample evidence\n<ul>\n<li>Update history showing last security update and last reboot time for two critical servers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"4-vulnerability-scanning-optional\">4) Vulnerability scanning (optional)</h3>\nIf you already have a scanner, use it. If not, focus on patch posture and exposed services.\n<ul>\n<li>Verify no unnecessary remote management interfaces are internet-exposed.</li>\n<li>Confirm remote access (VPN/RDP/SSH) is restricted.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"endpoints-email-and-data-protection-check-the-basics-that-reduce-impact\">Endpoints, email, and data protection: check the basics that reduce impact</h2>\nYou’re auditing preventative controls (stop attacks) and detective controls (notice them).\nWhat to check\n<h3 id=\"1-endpoint-protection-and-disk-encryption\">1) Endpoint protection and disk encryption</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Confirm EDR/AV is installed and healthy on the sampled endpoints.</li>\n<li>Confirm full-disk encryption is enabled on laptops.</li>\n</ul>\nExample spot check\n<ul>\n<li>On 5 sampled laptops: verify protection status is “active,” definitions current, and encryption is on.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2-email-protections-and-risky-settings\">2) Email protections and risky settings</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Confirm anti-phishing and spam filtering are enabled.</li>\n<li>Check whether auto-forwarding to external addresses is blocked or controlled.</li>\n</ul>\nExample\n<ul>\n<li>Search for mailbox rules that forward externally. Any unapproved forwarding is a high-priority finding.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"3-data-classification-simple-and-sharing-controls\">3) Data classification (simple) and sharing controls</h3>\nYou don’t need a complex scheme. Start with:\n<ul>\n<li>Public (ok to share)</li>\n<li>Internal (default)</li>\n<li>Restricted (client data, financials, credentials)</li>\n</ul>\nAudit actions\n<ul>\n<li>Confirm restricted data isn’t stored in unmanaged locations.</li>\n<li>Review sharing links for a sample of sensitive folders.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"4-logging-coverage\">4) Logging coverage</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Confirm you can access logs for identity sign-ins, endpoint alerts, and admin actions.</li>\n<li>Confirm log retention meets your operational needs (even 30–90 days is better than “unknown”).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"backups-and-incident-readiness-demonstrate-you-can-recover-and-respond\">Backups and incident readiness: demonstrate you can recover and respond</h2>\nBackups that have never been restored are hope, not a control. Your audit should include at least one restore test.\nWhat to check\n<h3 id=\"1-backup-scope\">1) Backup scope</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify your “crown jewel” systems: file shares, finance app, CRM data, email, key databases.</li>\n<li>Confirm each has a backup method and owner.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2-restore-test\">2) Restore test</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Perform one restore test per quarter (rotate systems).</li>\n<li>Document: what you restored, where, how long it took, and what broke.</li>\n</ul>\nExample restore test record\n<ul>\n<li>“Restored last night’s backup of the finance shared folder to an isolated location; validated 10 random files opened; restore time 22 minutes; permissions required adjustment.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"3-ransomware-resilience-basics\">3) Ransomware resilience basics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Confirm at least one backup copy is protected from routine admin credentials (separate account, separate system, or immutability if available).</li>\n<li>Confirm backup delete permissions are limited.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"4-incident-response-essentials\">4) Incident response essentials</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Verify you have an incident contact list and escalation path.</li>\n<li>Run a 30-minute tabletop exercise once or twice per year.</li>\n</ul>\nExample tabletop scenario\n<ul>\n<li>“User reports MFA push fatigue attempts and suspicious email rule creation.”</li>\n<li>Validate who disables the account, who checks mailbox rules, who communicates internally, and how you preserve evidence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"checklist\">Checklist</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[ ] Define audit scope (systems, users, and time period) and store it with the audit date.</li>\n<li>[ ] Export admin account list and confirm least privilege (remove unnecessary admin roles).</li>\n<li>[ ] Verify MFA coverage for all users and document any exceptions with compensating controls.</li>\n<li>[ ] Validate offboarding for one recent departure (account disabled, access removed, tokens revoked).</li>\n<li>[ ] Sample 10 endpoints to confirm EDR/AV healthy, disk encryption enabled, and OS version supported.</li>\n<li>[ ] Review patch posture for two critical servers and confirm last security update + last reboot time.</li>\n<li>[ ] Identify unmanaged assets by comparing endpoint inventory to another source (network/DHCP/purchasing).</li>\n<li>[ ] Check for risky email settings (external auto-forwarding, suspicious inbox rules) and remediate.</li>\n<li>[ ] Confirm backup coverage for crown jewel systems and run one documented restore test.</li>\n<li>[ ] Verify logging access and retention for identity, endpoints, and admin activity; ensure alerts reach the right mailbox/on-call.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"faq\">FAQ</h2>\nQ1: How often should a small IT team run an internal security audit?\nA: Do a small monthly check on one topic and a broader quarterly review of identity, patching, endpoints, and backups.\n<p>Q2: Do we need specialized audit software to do this well?\nA: No. A ticketing system, a shared folder for evidence, and exports/screenshots from existing tools are enough to start.</p>\n<p>Q3: What’s the most common “high severity” finding in small environments?\nA: Gaps in identity controls—missing MFA, too many admins, or incomplete offboarding—because they directly enable account takeover.</p>",
