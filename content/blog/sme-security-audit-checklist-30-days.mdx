## Intro
A security audit doesn’t have to be a massive, expensive project to be valuable. For most SMEs, the goal is to quickly find the biggest gaps, reduce obvious risk, and build a repeatable process. This 30-day checklist focuses on practical reviews you can complete with limited time and staff. You’ll end the month with clearer visibility, prioritized fixes, and documentation you can reuse.

## Quick take
- Focus on visibility first: assets, accounts, and data flows before tools.
- Fix high-risk basics fast: MFA, patching, backups, and admin access.
- Use evidence, not assumptions: screenshots, exports, and configuration notes.
- Review third-party access and data handling as carefully as internal systems.
- Finish with an action plan: owners, deadlines, and a re-audit cadence.

## Week 1: Set scope, inventory what you have, and map key data
A 30-day audit succeeds or fails based on scope and inventory. If you don’t know what systems and data exist, you can’t assess risk realistically.

### 1) Define scope and “crown jewels”
Start with a short scope statement (one page is fine):
- In-scope: endpoints (laptops/desktops), servers, cloud services (email, file storage, CRM), network gear, and key SaaS apps.
- Out-of-scope (for now): legacy systems that aren’t business-critical, R&D labs, or any environment you truly can’t access—just note them.
- Crown jewels: the data and systems that would hurt the most if leaked or unavailable (customer PII, accounting, payroll, email, shared drives, production systems).

Example: If you’re a 50-person professional services firm, email + file sharing + accounting are often higher priority than internal wiki tooling.

### 2) Build a lightweight asset inventory
You don’t need a perfect CMDB. You need a usable list:
- Devices: type, owner, OS, location, encryption status, endpoint protection status.
- Servers/workloads: purpose, OS, patch cadence, who administers them.
- Cloud/SaaS: what it is, who owns it internally, admin accounts, integrations.

Practical approach:
- Export device lists from your MDM (if you have one) and directory (e.g., your identity provider).
- For small shops without tooling, start with purchase records + DHCP leases + a quick staff survey.

### 3) Identify your critical data flows
Document (even as a simple diagram or bullet list):
- Where sensitive data is created (e.g., web forms, sales intake).
- Where it’s stored (cloud drive, CRM, accounting).
- Who can access it (teams, contractors).
- How it leaves the company (email, exports, third-party tools).

Example: “Leads captured on website → CRM → exported weekly to spreadsheet → shared via email” is a common risk chain worth tightening.

## Week 2: Review identity, access, and administrative control
Most SME incidents involve compromised accounts. Week 2 is about controlling who can log in and what they can do.

### 1) Establish access control principles
Use generic best practices aligned with frameworks like NIST, ISO 27001, or CIS Controls—without claiming compliance:
- Least privilege: users only get what they need.
- Separate admin accounts: avoid daily-use accounts being admins.
- Strong authentication: MFA everywhere it’s supported.

### 2) Audit accounts and privileges
Do these reviews with evidence (exports, screenshots, or configuration notes):
- List all users and admins in your identity system.
- Identify shared accounts (including “info@”, “admin@”, and vendor logins).
- Check for orphaned accounts (ex-employees, old contractors).

Example findings and fixes:
- Finding: Two IT staff use their daily accounts as global admins.
  Fix: Create separate admin accounts and require MFA + conditional access.
- Finding: A contractor still has access to the shared drive after project end.
  Fix: Remove access and add an offboarding checklist.

### 3) Confirm MFA coverage and recovery paths
It’s not enough to “have MFA.” Validate:
- Which apps enforce MFA (email, VPN, password manager, finance tools).
- Whether MFA is bypassable (legacy protocols, app passwords).
- Account recovery process (helpdesk resets, backup codes storage).

Example: If finance systems use email-based password resets, protect email as a top-tier asset and restrict who can reset finance accounts.

### 4) Tighten remote access
If you use VPN, remote desktop, or admin portals:
- Restrict access by role and device posture where possible.
- Disable direct RDP from the internet.
- Review firewall rules and exposed services.

## Week 3: Patch, harden, and back up for resilience
Week 3 focuses on reducing “easy wins” for attackers and ensuring you can recover.

### 1) Patch management reality check
Assess patching for:
- Operating systems (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Browsers and common apps
- Server OS and key services
- Network devices (routers, firewalls)

Practical guidance:
- Define patch SLAs by severity (e.g., critical faster than routine).
- Track exceptions: if you can’t patch a legacy system, isolate it and document compensating controls.

Example: A line-of-business app can’t run on the latest OS. You keep it, but you segment it, restrict inbound access, and monitor logins.

### 2) Configuration hardening essentials
You can’t harden everything at once. Prioritize:
- Endpoint encryption on laptops.
- Screen lock and inactivity timeouts.
- Disable local admin where possible.
- Secure baseline for email (block auto-forwarding externally, review suspicious mailbox rules).

Example: External auto-forwarding is often abused after account compromise. If you must allow it for a few roles, restrict it and review it monthly.

### 3) Backups you can actually restore
Audit backups with three questions:
- Are backups complete (all critical systems/data)?
- Are backups protected (separate credentials, immutable options if available)?
- Have you tested restore recently?

Minimum viable backup audit steps:
- Pick 1–2 critical systems and perform a restore test to a safe location.
- Verify you can restore both data and access (e.g., encryption keys, admin credentials).

Example: A file share backup exists, but the restore requires a departing admin’s personal account. Fix by moving backup access to documented admin roles.

## Week 4: Logging, vendors, and incident readiness
The final week turns your findings into operational readiness: detect issues, manage supplier risk, and respond quickly.

### 1) Logging and monitoring you can use
You may not have a full SOC, but you should have:
- Centralized logs for key systems (identity, email, endpoints, servers).
- Alerting for high-impact events: admin role changes, multiple failed logins, impossible travel, mailbox forwarding rules, disabled MFA.

Practical example:
- If someone adds a new global admin at 2:00 AM, you want a notification the same day, not next quarter.

### 2) Review third-party and SaaS risk
SMEs often outsource important functions. Do a vendor access and data handling review:
- List vendors with access to your systems or sensitive data.
- Confirm who approved them and who owns the relationship.
- Review integrations (OAuth apps, API keys, service accounts).
- Confirm contract basics: breach notification, data retention, and offboarding.

Example: A marketing tool connected to your email system with broad permissions. If it’s no longer needed, revoke OAuth access and remove API keys.

### 3) Validate incident response basics
You don’t need a 40-page plan. You need a runnable playbook:
- Roles: who decides, who communicates, who does technical containment.
- Contact list: IT, legal, insurer, critical vendors.
- First-hour steps: disable accounts, reset tokens, isolate devices, preserve logs.
- Communication: internal updates and customer messaging approval flow.

Example tabletop exercise (30 minutes):
- Scenario: CFO mailbox compromise.
- Actions: reset MFA, revoke sessions, review mailbox rules, notify bank if wire fraud is possible, check recent sent items.

### 4) Turn findings into a prioritized remediation plan
Close the audit with a short plan:
- Top 5 risks (plain language).
- Fixes with owners and deadlines.
- Quick wins (1–2 weeks) vs. projects (30–90 days).
- Re-audit schedule (monthly for access reviews, quarterly for vendor/integration reviews, and after major changes).

## FAQ
Q1: How do we do an audit if we don’t have a security team?
A: Assign a single audit owner, use exports from existing systems (identity, email, MDM), and focus on the checklist items that reduce the most risk quickly.

Q2: Should we run vulnerability scans as part of this 30-day audit?
A: If you already have a scanning tool, include it, but don’t let scanning replace basics like access control, patching discipline, and tested backups.

Q3: What’s the most common “high impact” fix SMEs can make fast?
A: Enforce MFA everywhere possible and reduce admin privileges—these two steps significantly cut down account-takeover risk.
