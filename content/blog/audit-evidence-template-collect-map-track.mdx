## Intro
Audits often fail for a simple reason: the evidence exists, but it’s scattered, unlabeled, and hard to connect to what the auditor is actually asking for. A lightweight evidence template fixes that by turning “send me proof” into a repeatable collection and tracking process. The goal isn’t to hoard documents—it’s to capture the right artifacts, show how they relate to security controls, and keep them current. This post provides a practical template you can copy into a spreadsheet or ticketing system and start using today.

## Quick take
- Use one evidence register (not email threads) as the single source of truth.
- Define each evidence item by control objective, owner, system, and time period.
- Prefer “evidence from systems” (exports, logs, configs) over screenshots where possible.
- Map artifacts to generic control families (access, change, backup, monitoring) to avoid gaps.
- Track freshness (how often it must be updated) to prevent last-minute scrambles.

## Build your evidence template (fields that matter)
A good evidence template is an “evidence register”: a table where each row is one evidence item. You can run it in a spreadsheet, GRC tool, or even a project board—but keep the fields consistent.

Core fields to include:

1) Evidence ID
Use a simple, stable naming scheme like `AE-001`, `AE-002`, etc. Stable IDs prevent confusion when filenames change.

2) Control/Requirement reference (generic)
Avoid overfitting to a single framework. Use a plain-language control statement plus an optional generic mapping tag, such as:
- “Access to production systems is restricted and reviewed” (maps to Access Control / IAM)
- “Changes to systems are approved and tracked” (maps to Change Management)
- “Backups are performed and restorations are tested” (maps to Backup/Recovery)

If you later need to align to NIST/ISO/CIS, you can add a column like “Framework mapping (optional)” without claiming compliance.

3) Evidence description
Write what the artifact is and what it demonstrates. Keep it testable.
Example: “Export of admin group members for production tenant, showing named accounts only; includes date/time of export.”

4) System/Scope
Where the evidence comes from (system name, environment, business unit). This reduces the “wrong system” problem.
Example: “Microsoft 365 tenant (prod), AWS account 123…, HRIS.”

5) Evidence type
Choose a small set to normalize reporting:
- Policy/procedure
- Configuration/export
- Log/report
- Ticket/approval record
- Training/attestation
- Vendor/third-party artifact

6) Owner and contributor(s)
The owner is accountable for producing/updating the artifact. Contributors can help gather data.

7) Collection method
How you get it in a repeatable way:
- “Export CSV from admin portal”
- “Query SIEM saved search”
- “Screenshot of settings page” (use only if exports are not available)

8) Period covered and as-of date
Auditors often care about time. Include:
- “Period covered” (e.g., Q4 2025)
- “As-of date” (e.g., 2026-01-31)

9) Storage location
One canonical location: a folder path, ticket link, or document repository URL. Don’t paste sensitive content into the register itself.

10) Sensitivity and handling
Label items that contain secrets, personal data, or security-sensitive configuration. Add handling notes like “redact tokens,” “share via secure link,” “restricted to audit team.”

11) Review cadence (freshness)
Set how often this evidence must be refreshed: monthly/quarterly/annually/on-change.

12) Status and notes
Statuses such as: Not started, In progress, Collected, Reviewed, Approved, Superseded. Notes capture exceptions and context.

Practical example row (you can copy this pattern):
- Evidence ID: AE-012
- Control statement: “Privileged access is reviewed periodically”
- Evidence description: “Quarterly privileged access review report including approver and remediation actions”
- System/Scope: “Cloud admin roles (prod)”
- Type: “Log/report”
- Owner: “IT Manager”
- Collection method: “Export role assignments + approval ticket list”
- Period covered: “Q1 2026”
- As-of date: “2026-03-31”
- Storage location: “Secure drive /Audit/2026/Q1/AE-012/”
- Sensitivity: “Restricted (privileged account list)”
- Review cadence: “Quarterly”
- Status: “Collected”
- Notes: “2 removals completed; 1 exception approved until project end.”

## Collect evidence efficiently (and avoid common traps)
The fastest way to lose time is collecting “pretty evidence” that doesn’t answer the question. Aim for artifacts that are (a) objective, (b) reproducible, and (c) tied to a time period.

Prioritize these sources:

1) System exports and reports
Exports (CSV/PDF) with timestamps are stronger than screenshots because they’re easier to validate and re-run.
Example: export of MFA enrollment status for all users as of a specific date.

2) Tickets and approvals
Change requests, access requests, incident tickets, and exception approvals often form the backbone of audit trails.
Example: link a firewall rule change ticket to the corresponding change window and approval.

3) Immutable logs or centrally collected logs
If you have centralized logging, capture evidence from there; it reduces “log on the server” disputes.
Example: a saved search showing successful and failed admin logins for the quarter.

Common traps to avoid:

- Over-collecting: Don’t dump a 300-page policy set if the audit asks for the onboarding procedure plus evidence of execution.
- Missing context: A screenshot without the system name, tenant, or timestamp is often unusable.
- Evidence that proves the opposite: A “backup configured” screenshot doesn’t prove backups ran successfully or that restores work.
- Stale artifacts: A policy last updated years ago might create uncomfortable questions. Track review dates.

A practical collection workflow:
- Create an evidence request ticket per evidence item (or bundle related items).
- The owner attaches/export uploads to the canonical location.
- A reviewer checks completeness against the evidence description and marks it “Reviewed.”
- If an exception exists (e.g., review missed), record it explicitly with dates and remediation plan.

## Map evidence to control families (NIST/ISO/CIS-friendly)
Mapping is what turns a folder of files into a defensible story. You don’t need perfect framework alignment; you need consistent coverage across common control areas.

Use a “Control family” column with a small controlled vocabulary. Here is a practical set that maps broadly to NIST/ISO/CIS concepts without claiming compliance:

- Governance & Policy
- Asset Inventory
- Identity & Access Management
- Privileged Access
- Security Awareness
- Vulnerability & Patch Management
- Secure Configuration
- Change Management
- Logging & Monitoring
- Incident Response
- Backup & Recovery
- Third-Party Risk

Example mapping (evidence → control family):

- “New user onboarding checklist + 3 sample completed access requests” → Identity & Access Management
- “Admin role membership export + quarterly review sign-off” → Privileged Access
- “Patch report for servers + exception approvals” → Vulnerability & Patch Management
- “Central logging retention settings + sample alert tickets” → Logging & Monitoring
- “Restore test report with results and issues tracked” → Backup & Recovery

How to use mapping day-to-day:
- Filter the register by control family to see where you have no evidence.
- Ensure each control family has both “design” evidence (policy/procedure/config) and “operating” evidence (logs/tickets showing it happened).
- For SMEs, start with the highest-risk families: IAM, patching, logging, backup/recovery, incident response.

## Track “freshness” and change (so audits aren’t a fire drill)
Most evidence breaks because it goes stale or the system changes. Your template should make staleness obvious.

Add these tracking columns:

- Freshness cadence: monthly / quarterly / annually / on-change
- Next due date: calculated from as-of date + cadence
- Trigger events: “new system,” “major upgrade,” “org change,” “security incident”
- Version / superseded by: link newer evidence IDs when you replace artifacts

Practical examples of freshness rules:

- MFA enrollment report: monthly (fast-changing user base)
- Privileged access review: quarterly
- Incident response tabletop exercise: annually
- Secure configuration baseline: on-change (and at least annually)
- Vendor security review: annually or on contract renewal

Operational tip: run a short monthly “evidence hygiene” meeting (15–20 minutes). Review what’s due in the next 30 days, assign owners, and close gaps early.

## Checklist
- [ ] Create a single evidence register with stable Evidence IDs (AE-001, AE-002…)
- [ ] Define a short list of control families (IAM, patching, logging, backup, IR, etc.)
- [ ] Write evidence descriptions that state what the artifact proves and the period covered
- [ ] Record system/scope for every evidence item (tenant/account/environment)
- [ ] Prefer exports/reports and ticket links over screenshots when possible
- [ ] Add sensitivity labels and handling notes for privileged or personal data
- [ ] Assign an owner and a reviewer for each evidence item
- [ ] Track as-of dates, cadence, and next due dates to prevent stale evidence
- [ ] Mark status consistently (Not started → Collected → Reviewed → Approved)
- [ ] Capture exceptions with remediation plans instead of hiding missing evidence

## FAQ
Q1: What’s the difference between an evidence register and a document folder?
A: A folder stores files; a register explains what each file is, what it proves, who owns it, and whether it’s current.

Q2: Are screenshots acceptable evidence?
A: Sometimes, but exports/logs are usually stronger because they’re repeatable and timestamped; use screenshots when exports aren’t available.

Q3: How much evidence is “enough” for an SME?
A: Enough to show both design (policy/config) and operation (logs/tickets) for your highest-risk controls, refreshed on a predictable cadence.
