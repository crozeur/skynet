## Intro
Security audits don’t have to be painful, expensive, or reserved for large enterprises. For SMEs, the goal is simple: quickly verify that the security basics are actually working, and that the riskiest gaps are visible and owned. This post gives you a lightweight approach you can run quarterly (and before major changes) without claiming “compliance.” Use it to gather evidence, spot high-impact fixes, and create a short, trackable action plan.

## Quick take
- Define scope and “crown jewels” first, or you’ll audit everything and learn nothing.
- Ask for evidence (screenshots, logs, configs, tickets), not promises.
- Prioritize identity, patching, backups, and monitoring—most SME incidents start there.
- Turn findings into owners, due dates, and verification steps.
- Repeat on a cadence (quarterly) and after major changes (new SaaS, M&A, new firewall).

## 1) Set the audit scope: systems, data, and acceptable risk
A good SME audit starts with boundaries. If you don’t define what matters most, your checklist becomes a long list of “nice-to-haves” and your team loses momentum.

Practical steps:
1. List your critical business services (e.g., email, file storage, ERP/finance, customer database, e-commerce, remote access). These are your primary audit targets.
2. Identify your “crown jewel” data types: customer PII, payment data, credentials/secrets, intellectual property, financial records.
3. Map where that data lives: endpoints, servers, SaaS apps, cloud storage, on-prem shares.
4. Define risk tolerance in plain language. Example: “We accept brief outages for internal tools, but not for billing; we can tolerate low-risk data exposure, but not customer PII.”

Example: If your customer database is in a SaaS CRM and your staff authenticate via a single identity provider, your audit should spend more time on identity controls (MFA, conditional access, logging) than on local server hardening.

Deliverable to produce:
- A one-page scope document: in-scope apps, networks, user groups, and a short “out of scope” list.

## 2) Collect evidence efficiently (and avoid checkbox theater)
Audits fail when they rely on verbal assurances: “Yes, we do backups.” Your goal is to collect lightweight evidence that a control exists and is effective.

Evidence types that work well for SMEs:
- Screenshots of key settings (MFA enforced, password policy, device encryption).
- Exported lists (admin accounts, MFA enrollment report, list of SaaS integrations).
- Sample logs (sign-in logs, endpoint alerts, firewall denies) covering the last 7–30 days.
- Tickets or change records showing patching, access approvals, and incidents.

How to sample without boiling the ocean:
- Pick a representative sample: 10–20 endpoints, 3–5 critical servers, 5–10 key SaaS apps.
- Sample by risk: executives, finance, IT admins, and remote users first.
- Validate “control works” by testing. Example: attempt to log in to a test account without MFA; confirm it is blocked.

Example “evidence request” you can send internally:
- “Provide the list of accounts with global admin privileges and proof of MFA enforcement.”
- “Provide the last successful restore test record (date, system, result).”
- “Provide the patch report showing OS and browser patch status for all managed endpoints.”

## 3) Audit the controls that stop real-world SME incidents
Most SME compromises trace back to a small set of control failures: weak identity hygiene, exposed remote access, unpatched systems, poor backups, and limited detection.

Below are practical audit themes and what “good” looks like—without overcomplicating it.

### Identity and access (especially admins)
- Ensure MFA is required for all users, and stronger requirements exist for admins.
- Reduce the number of admin accounts; use separate admin identities for privileged work.
- Review third-party access and SaaS integrations (OAuth apps, API keys, service accounts).

Example: If a finance mailbox can approve payments, verify that the account has MFA, that sign-ins are logged, and that mailbox forwarding rules are restricted and monitored.

### Patching and configuration
- Track patch status for OS, browsers, VPN clients, and key apps.
- Ensure unsupported systems are identified and either upgraded or isolated.
- Confirm configuration baselines for endpoints/servers: firewall on, disk encryption, secure remote management.

Example: If you use remote access tools, audit whether they’re restricted to corporate-managed devices and whether logs are retained.

### Backups and recovery
- Validate the “3-2-1” idea (multiple copies, multiple media, one offline/immutable if possible) in principle, even if implementation is simple.
- Ensure backups include SaaS data you rely on (email, file shares, CRM exports).
- Run restore tests and document outcomes.

Example: Don’t just confirm that backups run—restore a file and a system image to verify speed and integrity.

### Logging and detection
- Centralize at least critical logs: identity provider sign-ins, endpoint alerts, firewall/VPN logs.
- Ensure alerting is actionable and routed to a monitored channel.
- Define “minimum viable monitoring” for SMEs: account lockouts, impossible travel alerts (if available), new admin creation, suspicious inbox rules, ransomware/EDR high-severity alerts.

Example: If alerts go to an unmonitored mailbox, you effectively have no detection.

## 4) Turn findings into a realistic remediation plan
The audit is only useful if it drives measurable improvements. Keep the output short and operational.

A practical way to rank findings:
- Severity: What’s the impact if exploited (data loss, financial fraud, downtime)?
- Likelihood: Is it exposed to the internet? Is it common attack path? Is it already happening (alerts)?
- Effort: Low (hours), Medium (days), High (weeks/months).

Write findings in a format your team can execute:
- “Issue: MFA not enforced for legacy email access.
  - Risk: Account takeover via password spraying.
  - Evidence: Legacy protocol enabled; users can sign in without MFA.
  - Fix: Disable legacy auth; enforce MFA; monitor failed sign-ins.
  - Owner: IT Manager.
  - Due: 30 days.
  - Verify: Test sign-in; review sign-in logs.”

Aim for quick wins first:
- Disable unused accounts and stale admin privileges.
- Enforce MFA everywhere.
- Patch internet-facing systems.
- Run a restore test.

## Checklist

- [ ] Backups: Have you performed and documented a restore test in the last 90 days?

## FAQ
**1) How often should an SME run a security audit like this?**
Quarterly is a practical cadence, plus after major changes (new systems, mergers, big network changes) or after an incident.

**2) What’s the difference between an audit and a vulnerability scan?**
A vulnerability scan finds technical weaknesses; an audit checks whether key security controls and processes exist, work, and are evidenced.

**3) Do I need to follow NIST, ISO, or CIS to use this checklist?**
No. You can use this as a baseline; if you later align to NIST/ISO/CIS, this evidence and process will still help without claiming compliance.
