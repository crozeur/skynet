## Intro
Small IT teams don’t lose to attackers because they lack tools—they lose because alerts arrive faster than humans can make good decisions. A simple, consistent triage playbook helps you sort “needs action now” from “can wait” without burning out your team. This post gives you a repeatable workflow you can run with a basic SIEM/EDR plus your existing IT processes. The goal isn’t perfection; it’s faster, safer decisions with clear handoffs.

## Quick take
- Treat triage as a time-boxed decision: escalate, contain, monitor, or close.
- Use a consistent severity model based on business impact, exposure, and confidence.
- Start with context (asset, user, baseline behavior) before deep forensics.
- Standardize evidence capture and notes so anyone can pick up the case.
- Reduce noise continuously by tuning rules, enriching data, and fixing root causes.

## 1) Set a clear triage objective and time boxes
Triage is not the full investigation. It’s a structured, short process to decide what to do next.

Define four possible outcomes for every alert:

1. **Escalate**: This likely represents malicious activity and needs deeper investigation or incident response.
2. **Contain**: Take immediate action to reduce risk (isolate host, disable account, block hash/IP) while you investigate.
3. **Monitor**: Not enough evidence yet; keep under watch with specific follow-ups.
4. **Close**: Benign, duplicate, or explained by known change.

Suggested time boxes (adapt to your capacity):

- **Initial triage (5–15 minutes):** Identify what fired, what asset/user is involved, and whether there’s immediate risk.
- **Rapid validation (15–45 minutes):** Gather minimal evidence to support a decision and pick the outcome.
- **Escalation handoff (10 minutes):** If escalating, document what you know and what you already checked.

Practical example (small team reality):

- Alert: “Multiple failed logins followed by successful login” for an employee mailbox.
- Initial triage: Check if the source IP is unusual, whether MFA was used, and whether the account is privileged.
- Rapid validation: Look for impossible travel, new inbox rules, unusual OAuth consents, or sign-ins from atypical user agents.
- Outcome: If high confidence or high impact (executive mailbox, finance), contain (reset password, revoke sessions) and escalate.

Key principle: if you can’t finish triage quickly, that’s a signal to **escalate or contain**, not to spend hours in limbo.

## 2) Use a simple severity model you can apply consistently
Many alerting systems assign “high/medium/low,” but triage needs a severity model that reflects your business.

Use three inputs:

- **Impact (business harm if true):** privileged account, sensitive system, customer data, financial operations, production uptime.
- **Exposure (blast radius):** internet-facing, shared accounts, domain admin, widely deployed software, lateral movement potential.
- **Confidence (how likely it’s real):** strong telemetry + corroboration vs. one weak signal.

A practical scoring approach (no math required):

- **P1 (Urgent):** High impact OR high exposure with moderate/high confidence. Immediate containment or escalation.
- **P2 (Important):** Moderate impact/exposure with moderate confidence. Investigate within same business day.
- **P3 (Routine):** Low impact/exposure or low confidence. Monitor, tune, or close with documentation.

Examples:

- **P1:** “EDR reports credential dumping behavior” on a domain controller.
- **P2:** “New scheduled task created” on a workstation used by IT staff, but no other indicators.
- **P3:** “Port scan detected” against a non-production host behind VPN with a known vulnerability scan window.

To keep decisions consistent, document “what makes this P1/P2/P3” in two or three sentences in your playbook. Consistency matters more than the perfect model.

## 3) Triage workflow: the minimum evidence set (MES)
The biggest time sink in small SOC operations is chasing details before you have context. Start with a minimum evidence set you collect for every alert. Make it a template so you’re not improvising.

Minimum Evidence Set (collect what applies):

1. **Alert metadata:** rule name, detection source (SIEM/EDR/email), timestamp, severity, correlation IDs.
2. **Asset context:** hostname, IP, owner/team, business function, criticality, OS, location/network segment.
3. **User context:** username, role, department, privilege level, recent changes (new device, password reset, role change).
4. **Baseline comparison:** is this new for the asset/user? (new process, new country, new admin tool).
5. **Related activity window:** 30–60 minutes before and after the alert (logins, process creation, network connections).
6. **Immediate risk check:** signs of persistence, credential access, lateral movement, or data access.

Practical example: suspected malware execution alert

- Start: Identify the process name, parent process, command line, and hash.
- Context: Is this a server running line-of-business apps? Who owns it? Is it a kiosk?
- Baseline: Has this binary run before on this device fleet?
- Corroboration: Any DNS to newly seen domains, unusual outbound connections, or file writes to startup locations?
- Decision: If it’s a known admin tool executed by IT during a change window, close or monitor with a note. If it’s a user-launched binary from Downloads plus suspicious network calls, contain and escalate.

Tip for small teams: if you can only automate one thing, automate **enrichment** (asset criticality, user privilege, known change windows) so triage has context immediately.

## 4) Containment-first actions that won’t break your environment
Small IT teams often delay containment because they fear business disruption. The solution is to pre-approve safe containment options by scenario.

Create a “containment menu” with guardrails:

- **Account actions:** force password reset, revoke sessions/tokens, disable account temporarily, require MFA re-registration.
- **Endpoint actions:** isolate host from network (EDR), block execution by hash, quarantine file, kill process.
- **Network actions:** block IP/domain temporarily (with expiration), add DNS sinkhole entry, restrict egress for a host segment.
- **Email actions:** purge message, block sender/domain, remove malicious inbox rules.

Guardrails to reduce accidental outages:

- Time-bound blocks (e.g., 4–24 hours) unless confirmed malicious.
- Always capture evidence (screenshots/log exports) before destructive steps when feasible.
- Maintain an emergency contact list for business owners of critical systems.
- For critical servers, prefer “contain at the account/network layer” before isolating the host.

Example: suspicious OAuth app consent (cloud identity)

- Contain: revoke the app’s permissions, revoke user sessions, reset password if necessary.
- Validate: check audit logs for consent grant, sign-in anomalies, mailbox rule changes.
- Escalate: if the app was granted broad scopes or multiple users are affected.

The objective is to reduce risk quickly while you investigate—especially when confidence is high but details are still emerging.

## 5) Close the loop: documentation, tuning, and root-cause fixes
If your SOC workflow ends at “close alert,” you’ll relive the same noise every week. Use a lightweight closure routine that feeds improvement.

For every closed or resolved alert, capture:

- **Disposition:** true positive, false positive, benign true positive (expected but worth logging), or duplicate.
- **Why:** one or two sentences referencing the evidence that supported the decision.
- **Action taken:** containment steps, tickets opened, stakeholder notified.
- **Follow-up:** tuning request, missing log source, endpoint hardening, user coaching, or policy update.

Noise reduction tactics that work for SMEs:

- **Fix data quality first:** correct time sync, ensure key logs are onboarding properly, standardize hostnames.
- **Tune with intent:** suppress alerts only with a documented reason and an expiration date.
- **Reduce duplicates:** deduplicate correlated alerts into a single “case” per asset/user per time window.
- **Address recurring causes:** if “powershell suspicious” is constant due to IT scripts, sign scripts, use approved admin tooling, or narrow the detection to risky patterns.

Framework alignment (kept generic):

- NIST/ISO/CIS-style programs all benefit from repeatable triage, clear incident categories, evidence handling, and continuous improvement—even if you’re not claiming compliance.

- [ ] Add escalation paths and after-hours contacts for critical systems and executives

## FAQ
**1) How do we triage alerts if we only have one person on security?**
Use strict time boxes and a containment-first approach for high-impact alerts. Standardize your evidence template so another IT teammate can step in when needed.

**2) When should we contain immediately instead of investigating more?**
Contain when potential impact is high (privileged access, sensitive systems) or when you have multiple corroborating signals. You can always roll back time-bound containment if it’s benign.

**3) What’s the fastest way to reduce alert fatigue?**
Improve enrichment and close-loop tuning: add asset/user context to every alert, deduplicate into cases, and fix the root causes behind repeat false positives.
