## Intro (3–5 sentences)
Audits go off the rails when “evidence” means a pile of screenshots and exports with no clear connection to the risk you’re trying to manage. An audit evidence template fixes that by tying each risk to (1) what “good” looks like, (2) the proof you’ll gather, and (3) the remediation steps if the proof shows gaps. For SMEs, this approach reduces disruption: you spend less time hunting for artifacts and more time improving security. It also helps IT managers explain priorities to leadership in plain language.

## Quick take (exactly 5 bullet points)
- Evidence is only useful if it maps to a specific risk and control outcome.
- Standardize evidence requests so audits don’t depend on one person’s memory.
- Prefer repeatable artifacts (reports, configs, logs) over one-off screenshots.
- Record “exceptions” with an owner and expiry date, not as permanent workarounds.
- Track remediation in the same template so findings turn into action.

## Build the template: risk → control outcome → evidence → fix
Start with a simple table that you can run in a spreadsheet, ticketing system, or GRC-lite document. The key is that every row is auditable and actionable.

Recommended columns (add/remove as needed):
- Asset / process: What’s in scope (e.g., “M365 email,” “laptops,” “customer portal”).
- Risk statement: One sentence in business terms (e.g., “Unauthorized access to email leads to fraud and data leakage”).
- Control outcome (desired state): What you expect to be true (e.g., “MFA is enforced for all users”).
- Control owner: Team or role responsible (IT, HR, Finance, Engineering).
- Evidence requested: The artifact(s) you will collect.
- Evidence source: Where it comes from (system, repo, ticketing tool, policy folder).
- Collection method: Export, report, query, config snapshot, log sample.
- Frequency / point-in-time: Monthly, quarterly, annually, or “as of audit date.”
- Validation steps: How the auditor or reviewer can confirm it’s meaningful.
- Result: Pass / fail / partial / not applicable.
- Finding description (if any): Clear statement of the gap.
- Remediation action(s): What will be done to fix it.
- Remediation owner & due date: One accountable person and a date.
- Exception? (Y/N): If not fixing now, document why.
- Exception expiry & compensating controls: How risk is reduced until fixed.

Example row (condensed):
- Asset/process: Email
- Risk: Account takeover enables invoice fraud
- Outcome: MFA enforced; legacy auth blocked
- Evidence: MFA enforcement policy export + sign-in report showing legacy auth blocks
- Validation: Confirm policy applies to all users; sample 10 recent sign-ins
- Result: Partial
- Finding: Two service accounts excluded without compensating controls
- Fix: Convert to managed identities or add strong auth; restrict IP
- Owner/due: IT Manager / 30 days

This structure works whether you align controls loosely to NIST/ISO/CIS language or keep it entirely internal. The point is traceability, not claiming compliance.

## Choose evidence that is repeatable and reviewable (not “pretty”)
Common failure mode: evidence that looks convincing but can’t be re-verified. When possible, pick artifacts that are:

### 1) System-generated
- Examples: access review exports, endpoint compliance reports, backup job logs, vulnerability scan summaries.
- Why: they reduce the risk of “manual curation” and can be re-run.

### 2) Time-bound and scoped
- Specify “as of” date and scope (e.g., “All production servers,” “All active employees,” “Last 30 days”).
- Avoid: “Here’s a screenshot of the dashboard,” unless you also record the filters and timeframe.

### 3) Verifiable by a third party
- Include enough context for a reviewer to reproduce the check.
- Example: “Run query X in the log tool for admin logins in last 14 days” is verifiable; “No suspicious activity observed” is not.

### 4) Minimal and privacy-aware
- Evidence should demonstrate the control without exposing unnecessary personal data.
- Tip: redact or aggregate where possible, and store evidence securely with limited access.

Practical examples of better evidence choices:
- Password policy: export of directory password/MFA settings, not a Word doc saying “we require strong passwords.”
- Joiner/mover/leaver: HR-to-IT ticket samples for 5 random users showing timestamps and approvals.
- Backups: backup job success logs plus a restore test ticket (date, scope, result).
- Patching: endpoint/server compliance report plus an exception list with reasons and expiry.

## Map common SME risks to evidence (examples you can copy)
Below are examples you can adapt to your environment. Each example shows a risk, the control outcome, and the evidence to request.

### 1) Privileged access misuse
- Risk: Admin accounts are used for daily work, increasing impact of compromise.
- Outcome: Admin access is limited, separated, and monitored.
- Evidence:
  - List of privileged accounts and assigned owners
  - Proof of role-based access approvals (tickets/requests)
  - Admin sign-in log sample (e.g., last 30 days)
  - Access review record (quarterly or point-in-time)
- Fix ideas:
  - Remove standing admin rights; use just-in-time elevation where possible
  - Require MFA for admins and block risky legacy methods
  - Centralize logging for admin activity

### 2) Unpatched systems
- Risk: Known vulnerabilities lead to ransomware or data breach.
- Outcome: Patches are applied within defined timelines; exceptions are managed.
- Evidence:
  - Patch compliance report by severity and age
  - Exception register entries (owner, reason, expiry)
  - Change/ticket records for recent patch cycles
- Fix ideas:
  - Define patch SLAs (e.g., critical vs. routine)
  - Standardize maintenance windows
  - Track exceptions like debt, not like a preference

### 3) Phishing and credential theft
- Risk: Users fall for phishing, enabling account takeover.
- Outcome: MFA is enforced; awareness and reporting are operational.
- Evidence:
  - MFA enforcement policy and coverage metrics
  - Secure email configuration summary (generic: anti-phishing/anti-spoofing settings)
  - User reporting process (how to report, who triages) + 2–3 recent incident tickets
- Fix ideas:
  - Enforce MFA for all users (including executives)
  - Ensure reporting inbox/channel is monitored and has SLAs
  - Run periodic simulations only if you have a plan to improve outcomes

### 4) Data loss from misconfiguration
- Risk: Sensitive data is shared publicly or accessed by the wrong people.
- Outcome: Data is classified, access is limited, and sharing is monitored.
- Evidence:
  - Data classification/handling guidance (short and practical)
  - Sample of shared resources with access lists (e.g., 10 items)
  - DLP or access audit logs (if available) or manual review records
- Fix ideas:
  - Reduce “anyone with link” sharing
  - Review group memberships and external sharing
  - Define retention and deletion where feasible

### 5) Backup and recovery failure
- Risk: You can’t restore critical systems after an incident.
- Outcome: Backups run successfully and restores are tested.
- Evidence:
  - Backup schedules and last-success logs
  - Restore test record (what was restored, when, outcome)
  - RPO/RTO expectations documented (even if approximate)
- Fix ideas:
  - Add restore tests to the calendar
  - Separate backup credentials and limit access
  - Ensure backups are protected from deletion/tampering

## Turn evidence into remediation: severity, ownership, and closure
Your template shouldn’t end at “pass/fail.” It should make it easy to decide what to do next.

A simple remediation workflow for SMEs:

### 1) Rate impact and likelihood (qualitative)
- Use a consistent scale (e.g., Low/Medium/High) and define it in one paragraph.
- Example definitions:
  - High impact: could stop operations, cause major financial loss, or expose regulated data.
  - High likelihood: exposed to internet, widely exploited, or no compensating control.

### 2) Assign one owner per finding
- Teams can help, but accountability is single-threaded.

### 3) Define “done” criteria in the template
- Example: “MFA enforced for all users, exclusions list is empty or documented with compensating controls and expiry.”

### 4) Document exceptions like risk decisions
- If leadership accepts risk temporarily, record:
  - reason, compensating control, expiry date, and review date
- An exception with no expiry becomes a permanent vulnerability.

### 5) Close the loop with evidence of the fix
- The remediation itself needs evidence (new report, updated config export, successful test ticket). Reuse the same “evidence requested” field so closure is consistent.

## FAQ (3 questions with short answers)
Q1: How much evidence is enough?
A: Enough to prove the control outcome for the full scope and timeframe—prefer a small number of strong, repeatable artifacts over many screenshots.

Q2: What if we don’t have tools that generate good reports?
A: Use what you have (configs, tickets, manual samples) but document the method and add a plan to automate the highest-effort evidence over time.

Q3: How often should we refresh the evidence?
A: Match the refresh to risk: high-risk controls (access, backups, patching) should be reviewed more frequently than low-change areas (some policies).
