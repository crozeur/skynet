## Intro
Internal security audits don’t have to be “big company” projects. For small IT teams, the goal is to confirm that everyday controls are actually working, not to produce a perfect report. A lightweight, repeatable audit helps you catch gaps before an attacker (or an outage) does. This post gives you a practical checklist and a simple way to run it quarterly—without buying new tools.

## Quick take
- Focus on high-impact areas first: identity, patching, backups, and endpoint security.
- Audit what’s real, not what’s written: validate with spot checks and evidence.
- Keep scope small: pick a handful of systems and users each cycle.
- Track findings as tickets with owners and due dates, not as a static document.
- Re-audit closed items to confirm the fix actually reduced risk.

## Build a lightweight audit plan (scope, timing, evidence)
A small team can’t audit everything at once. Instead, define a tight scope and rotate.

### 1) Pick a cadence you can sustain
- Monthly “mini-audit” (30–60 minutes): one topic (e.g., MFA coverage).
- Quarterly audit (half-day to one day): identity + patching + backups + endpoints.
- Annual deeper dive: vendor access, network segmentation, incident response tabletop.

### 2) Define the audit scope in one paragraph
Example scope statement:
“Review identity controls for Microsoft 365 and VPN, patch status for Windows endpoints and two critical servers, backup restore capability for the file share, and admin access to core systems.”

### 3) Decide what counts as evidence
Avoid long narratives. Use simple, verifiable artifacts:
- Screenshots of settings pages
- Exported user lists (admins, MFA status)
- Patch reports / update history
- Backup job logs plus a restore test record
- Ticket IDs for remediation actions

### 4) Use sampling to stay sane
If you have 120 endpoints, don’t inspect all 120.
- Sample 10 endpoints across departments
- Sample 10 user accounts (including at least 2 executives and 2 contractors)
- Sample 2 critical servers and 1 “forgotten” server

Practical tip: Keep an “audit notebook” in a shared folder with dated subfolders. Store only what you need (and protect it—these artifacts can be sensitive).

## Identity and access: verify the controls that stop most breaches
Identity is the control plane for cloud apps, VPN, and admin tools. Small misconfigurations here can undo strong endpoint protection.

What to check
### 1) MFA coverage and exceptions
- Verify MFA is enabled for all users, especially email and remote access.
- List any exceptions (service accounts, break-glass accounts) and confirm compensating controls.

Example evidence
- Export from your IdP showing MFA status.
- A short note documenting why a service account can’t use MFA and how it’s protected (e.g., long random password in a vault, restricted sign-in locations).

### 2) Admin accounts and privilege boundaries
- Ensure admins use separate accounts for administrative tasks.
- Confirm least privilege: who is global admin, domain admin, local admin?

Example spot check
- Pick two admins and confirm:
  - Their day-to-day account is not an admin
  - Admin account has MFA
  - Admin sign-in logs show expected behavior

### 3) Offboarding and contractor access
- Validate a recent offboarding case end-to-end: account disabled, tokens revoked, groups removed, mailbox access handled, VPN removed.

Example
- Choose one terminated user from the last 60 days. Confirm the disable timestamp and last successful login are aligned with policy.

### 4) Password policy and account recovery
- Confirm password policy is reasonable and consistent.
- Review how users reset passwords (helpdesk workflow, identity verification).

Framework hint (generic)
If you map to CIS/NIST/ISO later, this identity work aligns with common access control and authentication control families—but don’t treat this audit as a “compliance” exercise.

## Systems and patching: prove you can keep up with known vulnerabilities
Patching is where small teams get overwhelmed. The audit should surface bottlenecks and unmanaged assets.

What to check
### 1) Asset inventory accuracy
- Can you produce a list of laptops, desktops, servers, and key SaaS admins?
- Identify unmanaged or unknown devices.

Example
- Compare your endpoint management list to DHCP leases or your purchasing records. Any “ghost” devices are audit findings.

### 2) Patch SLAs (service level targets)
Define simple targets (internal goals) and audit against them:
- Critical security updates: within 14 days
- High: within 30 days
- Third-party apps (browsers, PDF readers): within 14–30 days

No need to cite stats; just pick targets you can meet and improve.

### 3) Server patching and reboot reality
- Confirm servers actually reboot when needed.
- Validate maintenance windows exist and are used.

Example evidence
- Update history showing last security update and last reboot time for two critical servers.

### 4) Vulnerability scanning (optional)
If you already have a scanner, use it. If not, focus on patch posture and exposed services.
- Verify no unnecessary remote management interfaces are internet-exposed.
- Confirm remote access (VPN/RDP/SSH) is restricted.

## Endpoints, email, and data protection: check the basics that reduce impact
You’re auditing preventative controls (stop attacks) and detective controls (notice them).

What to check
### 1) Endpoint protection and disk encryption
- Confirm EDR/AV is installed and healthy on the sampled endpoints.
- Confirm full-disk encryption is enabled on laptops.

Example spot check
- On 5 sampled laptops: verify protection status is “active,” definitions current, and encryption is on.

### 2) Email protections and risky settings
- Confirm anti-phishing and spam filtering are enabled.
- Check whether auto-forwarding to external addresses is blocked or controlled.

Example
- Search for mailbox rules that forward externally. Any unapproved forwarding is a high-priority finding.

### 3) Data classification (simple) and sharing controls
You don’t need a complex scheme. Start with:
- Public (ok to share)
- Internal (default)
- Restricted (client data, financials, credentials)

Audit actions
- Confirm restricted data isn’t stored in unmanaged locations.
- Review sharing links for a sample of sensitive folders.

### 4) Logging coverage
- Confirm you can access logs for identity sign-ins, endpoint alerts, and admin actions.
- Confirm log retention meets your operational needs (even 30–90 days is better than “unknown”).

## Backups and incident readiness: demonstrate you can recover and respond
Backups that have never been restored are hope, not a control. Your audit should include at least one restore test.

What to check
### 1) Backup scope
- Identify your “crown jewel” systems: file shares, finance app, CRM data, email, key databases.
- Confirm each has a backup method and owner.

### 2) Restore test
- Perform one restore test per quarter (rotate systems).
- Document: what you restored, where, how long it took, and what broke.

Example restore test record
- “Restored last night’s backup of the finance shared folder to an isolated location; validated 10 random files opened; restore time 22 minutes; permissions required adjustment.”

### 3) Ransomware resilience basics
- Confirm at least one backup copy is protected from routine admin credentials (separate account, separate system, or immutability if available).
- Confirm backup delete permissions are limited.

### 4) Incident response essentials
- Verify you have an incident contact list and escalation path.
- Run a 30-minute tabletop exercise once or twice per year.

Example tabletop scenario
- “User reports MFA push fatigue attempts and suspicious email rule creation.”
- Validate who disables the account, who checks mailbox rules, who communicates internally, and how you preserve evidence.

## Checklist
- [ ] Define audit scope (systems, users, and time period) and store it with the audit date.
- [ ] Export admin account list and confirm least privilege (remove unnecessary admin roles).
- [ ] Verify MFA coverage for all users and document any exceptions with compensating controls.
- [ ] Validate offboarding for one recent departure (account disabled, access removed, tokens revoked).
- [ ] Sample 10 endpoints to confirm EDR/AV healthy, disk encryption enabled, and OS version supported.
- [ ] Review patch posture for two critical servers and confirm last security update + last reboot time.
- [ ] Identify unmanaged assets by comparing endpoint inventory to another source (network/DHCP/purchasing).
- [ ] Check for risky email settings (external auto-forwarding, suspicious inbox rules) and remediate.
- [ ] Confirm backup coverage for crown jewel systems and run one documented restore test.
- [ ] Verify logging access and retention for identity, endpoints, and admin activity; ensure alerts reach the right mailbox/on-call.

## FAQ
Q1: How often should a small IT team run an internal security audit?
A: Do a small monthly check on one topic and a broader quarterly review of identity, patching, endpoints, and backups.

Q2: Do we need specialized audit software to do this well?
A: No. A ticketing system, a shared folder for evidence, and exports/screenshots from existing tools are enough to start.

Q3: What’s the most common “high severity” finding in small environments?
A: Gaps in identity controls—missing MFA, too many admins, or incomplete offboarding—because they directly enable account takeover.
