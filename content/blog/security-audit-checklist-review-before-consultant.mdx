## Intro
Security consultants can move faster—and give you more useful findings—when you’ve already gathered the basics. A “pre-audit” review doesn’t require deep security expertise; it’s mostly about organizing evidence, validating assumptions, and identifying obvious gaps. This post walks through what to review before you call a consultant so your engagement starts with clarity instead of confusion. Use it to reduce billable discovery time, avoid surprises, and ensure the audit focuses on real risk.

## Quick take
- Define the audit goal and scope in plain language before talking tools or frameworks.
- Build an accurate inventory of systems, accounts, and data flows (even if imperfect).
- Verify identity and access basics: who has admin, how access is granted, and how it’s revoked.
- Confirm you can produce logs, backup proof, and incident-response contacts on request.
- Collect policies and “how it actually works” notes to close the gap between paperwork and reality.

## Set the scope and success criteria (before you gather evidence)
A security audit can mean many things: a control review, a technical assessment, a gap analysis against a framework (like NIST, ISO, or CIS), or preparation for a customer questionnaire. If you don’t define the “why,” you risk paying for thoroughness in the wrong places.

Practical steps:

1) Write the goal in one sentence.
- Example: “Identify the top risks to customer data in our cloud apps and create a prioritized remediation plan.”
- Example: “Validate our baseline security controls for a new insurance requirement (without claiming compliance).”

2) Define what’s in scope.
- Systems: email, endpoints, cloud tenancy, ERP/CRM, remote access, on-prem servers, websites, third parties.
- Locations: HQ only vs. all sites; employee-owned devices vs. corporate-managed devices.
- People: employees, contractors, managed service providers (MSPs).

3) Define what “done” looks like.
- Deliverables: a written report, risk register, executive summary, remediation roadmap, or a re-test.
- Format: severity ratings, evidence-based findings, ownership mapping, timelines.

4) List non-goals.
- Example: “This is not a penetration test.”
- Example: “We are not seeking a compliance attestation.”

Tip for IT managers: create a short “audit brief” (one page) and share it internally. It reduces friction when the consultant asks for access, logs, or documentation.

## Build an asset and data inventory that’s “good enough”
Consultants can’t assess risk if they don’t know what exists. SMEs often discover “shadow IT” (tools bought by teams) or forgotten systems during an audit. You don’t need perfection—just a defensible starting point.

What to inventory:

1) Systems and services
- Cloud platforms and tenants/subscriptions (e.g., productivity suite, cloud hosting).
- Business apps (accounting, CRM, HR/payroll, helpdesk, e-commerce).
- Network components: firewalls, VPN, Wi‑Fi, switches, DNS, remote access.
- Endpoint management and security tools (if any): MDM, EDR/AV, patching.

2) Accounts and identity stores
- Your primary identity provider (IdP) or directory service.
- Admin portals for SaaS tools.
- “Shared” accounts and service accounts (often overlooked).

3) Data locations and flows
- Where sensitive data lives: customer data, employee data, financial data, intellectual property.
- How data moves: integrations, exports to spreadsheets, email forwarding, SFTP, APIs.

Examples that commonly matter in audits:
- A marketing form that pushes leads into a CRM, which then syncs to email marketing.
- A finance team downloading monthly reports to local laptops.
- A helpdesk tool with attachments containing PII.

How to make this easier:
- Export application lists from your SSO/IdP (if you use one).
- Pull device lists from MDM or endpoint management.
- Ask department heads: “What tools do you pay for monthly that IT didn’t set up?”

## Check identity, access, and admin privileges (the fastest risk reducer)
Many high-impact findings come down to who can access what—and how easily an attacker could take over an account. Before a consultant arrives, verify your access basics and document what you find.

Key areas to review:

1) Admin accounts
- How many global/admin accounts exist across critical systems?
- Are admin accounts separate from daily-use accounts?
- Is admin access time-limited or permanently assigned?

Example:
- If your IT lead uses the same account for email and global admin, a successful phishing attempt could become a full environment takeover.

2) Joiner/mover/leaver (JML) process
- Who requests access for new hires?
- How are permissions changed when roles change?
- How quickly is access removed when someone leaves?

Practical check:
- Pick two recently departed employees and confirm their accounts are disabled everywhere (email, SaaS apps, VPN, shared folders). Document how you verified it.

3) Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Is MFA enabled for all users or just admins?
- Are there exceptions (service accounts, legacy protocols)?
- Is there a recovery process that can be abused (e.g., SMS-only resets, shared inbox approvals)?

4) Password and session controls
- Do you allow long-lived sessions on admin portals?
- Do you have password managers or are passwords shared in spreadsheets/chats?

If you want a consultant to be effective, be ready to provide:
- A list of privileged roles per system.
- A description of how access requests are approved.
- Evidence screenshots or exports showing MFA and admin role assignments.

## Validate logging, backups, and incident readiness (so findings are actionable)
An audit is not only about prevention. Consultants will likely ask, “Can you detect problems, recover quickly, and respond in a coordinated way?” If you can’t produce evidence for these areas, the audit may stall.

1) Logging and monitoring
- What logs do you retain (authentication, admin actions, endpoint alerts, firewall/VPN, SaaS audit logs)?
- Where are they stored, and for how long?
- Who reviews alerts, and what triggers escalation?

Example of a practical test:
- Attempt a controlled login from a test account, then confirm the event appears in your logs and you can find it within 10 minutes.

2) Backups and restore proof
- Do you back up critical SaaS data (or only endpoints/servers)?
- Are backups isolated from normal admin accounts?
- When was your last successful restore test?

Important nuance:
- “We have backups” is not evidence. A restore test (even a small one) is much more convincing to an auditor and more useful to you.

3) Incident response basics
- Who is the incident lead and the technical lead?
- Do you have an out-of-band contact list (not only email)?
- Do you know who to call for legal, cyber insurance, forensics, and PR (if needed)?

You don’t need a perfect incident response plan, but you should be able to answer:
- “If we suspect ransomware at 9 a.m., who makes the decision to shut down systems?”

## Gather core documents and “how it actually works” notes
Consultants will ask for policies and procedures—but SMEs often have a gap between documented policy and real operations. You can help by assembling both: what’s written, and what’s true.

Documents worth gathering:
- Acceptable use policy and basic security policy (even if simple).
- Onboarding/offboarding steps (JML).
- Asset inventory and network diagrams (even rough).
- Vendor list and contracts for critical providers (MSP, payroll, hosting, email).
- Security training approach (what you do, how often).
- Patch/vulnerability management notes (who patches what, cadence).
- Change management notes (how changes are approved and tracked).

Operational “truth notes” to include:
- “We intend MFA for all users, but the warehouse tablets don’t support it.”
- “Patches are monthly for laptops, but servers are ad-hoc.”
- “The MSP manages firewall rules; IT approves changes by email.”

Why this helps:
- It lets the consultant focus on risk-based recommendations instead of debating whether the policy is real.
- It reduces “unknown unknowns” that drive scope creep.

## Checklist
- [ ] Write a one-sentence audit goal and list 3–5 priority concerns (e.g., ransomware, customer data exposure, business email compromise).
- [ ] Define scope: systems, locations, users (employees/contractors), and any exclusions.
- [ ] Create an application inventory (SaaS + on-prem) with owners and business purpose.
- [ ] Export a device list (laptops/desktops/servers/mobile) and note management status (managed vs. unmanaged).
- [ ] List privileged/admin accounts per critical system and confirm MFA status.
- [ ] Document the joiner/mover/leaver process and verify two recent leavers are fully deprovisioned.
- [ ] Confirm where logs exist, retention period, and who reviews alerts (or note that nobody does yet).
- [ ] Verify backups for critical systems and record the last restore test date and result.
- [ ] List critical third parties (MSP, hosting, payroll, payment processors) and how access is granted/revoked.
- [ ] Assemble key policies/procedures and add “how it actually works” notes for known exceptions.

## FAQ
Q1: Do we need to follow a framework like NIST, ISO, or CIS for an audit?
A: Not necessarily; you can use them as a reference structure, but the audit should be driven by your risks and business needs.

Q2: What’s the most common thing that slows down a security audit?
A: Missing inventories and unclear access ownership—if nobody can say who owns a system or who approves admin access, evidence collection drags.

Q3: Should we fix issues before the consultant arrives?
A: Fix obvious, low-risk-to-change items (like enabling MFA for admins), but avoid major changes without tracking them—auditors need stable evidence and a clear before/after trail.
